<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="14.24" dur="5.129">so this is the circuit that actually</text><text start="16.529" dur="5.041">makes this thing work I this is the</text><text start="19.369" dur="4.361">transmitter so the part that&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="21.57" dur="7.5">in the foot pedal outside that generates</text><text start="23.73" dur="8.639">a signal and sends it and this is the</text><text start="29.07" dur="5.43">receiver which is what&amp;#39;s in that little</text><text start="32.369" dur="5.041">like hot glued bundle that is plugged</text><text start="34.5" dur="5.73">into the wall underneath the bench</text><text start="37.41" dur="4.71">this is where the noise actually comes</text><text start="40.23" dur="4.8">from that we hear when the foot pedal</text><text start="42.12" dur="5.85">gets pushed so when the foot pedal is</text><text start="45.03" dur="4.68">pushed this switch closes and it</text><text start="47.97" dur="3.87">basically just delivers 9 volts to the</text><text start="49.71" dur="3.63">rest of the circuit so the rest of the</text><text start="51.84" dur="6.42">circuit in this case does two things</text><text start="53.34" dur="7.59">first there&amp;#39;s a a stable 555 and that</text><text start="58.26" dur="4.799">will basically generate a square wave</text><text start="60.93" dur="4.439">and in this case I think it&amp;#39;s about 70</text><text start="63.059" dur="4.711">Hertz and the duty cycle is a little</text><text start="65.369" dur="4.981">over fifty percent so I&amp;#39;ll exaggerate</text><text start="67.77" dur="4.02">that a little bit here but you get a</text><text start="70.35" dur="3.96">square wave out that looks like that</text><text start="71.79" dur="6.24">that is the signal on that wire right</text><text start="74.31" dur="4.62">there so this chip is the important</text><text start="78.03" dur="4.53">thing because that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="78.93" dur="6.299">allowing it to talk over radio and these</text><text start="82.56" dur="6.089">chips are really simplistic all that</text><text start="85.229" dur="6.091">they do is generate the carrier tone and</text><text start="88.649" dur="4.821">then they modulate it with the signal</text><text start="91.32" dur="5.909">that you give them in this case it&amp;#39;s I</text><text start="93.47" dur="7.509">an AM signal and it is generating a</text><text start="97.229" dur="6.03">carrier tone of 433 megahertz so when</text><text start="100.979" dur="3.991">the signal you send it is low the</text><text start="103.259" dur="4.081">amplitude that because it&amp;#39;s amplitude</text><text start="104.97" dur="4.83">modulated is going to be zero so the</text><text start="107.34" dur="6.69">signal out of the antenna is basically</text><text start="109.8" dur="6.209">zero as soon as this gets turned hi out</text><text start="114.03" dur="6.75">the square wave it immediately starts</text><text start="116.009" dur="8.631">going nuts at 433 megahertz and then</text><text start="120.78" dur="6.66">when it gets to the next Bob the</text><text start="124.64" dur="5.77">lowering in the square wave it will</text><text start="127.44" dur="5.1">flatten off again and basically send</text><text start="130.41" dur="5.24">nothing and then when it goes the next</text><text start="132.54" dur="8.58">one it&amp;#39;ll oscillate like crazy again and</text><text start="135.65" dur="8.62">then go flat so you actually have the</text><text start="141.12" dur="6.119">transmitter turning on full blast when</text><text start="144.27" dur="4.89">the square wave is high and the</text><text start="147.239" dur="3.781">transmitter off when the square wave is</text><text start="149.16" dur="4.35">low and that&amp;#39;s the signal that&amp;#39;s getting</text><text start="151.02" dur="5.13">sent whenever the foot pedal is</text><text start="153.51" dur="4.71">depressed so when this signal gets to</text><text start="156.15" dur="4.559">the receiver it&amp;#39;s reasonably easy to</text><text start="158.22" dur="4.56">pick up but the difficult part is</text><text start="160.709" dur="3.721">actually determining whether or not</text><text start="162.78" dur="3.57">you&amp;#39;re receiving a signal or whether</text><text start="164.43" dur="5.04">you&amp;#39;re receiving noise because these</text><text start="166.35" dur="4.33">chips have just enough brains in them</text><text start="169.47" dur="3.939">that they&amp;#39;re really really</text><text start="170.68" dur="5.309">knowing they actually the receiver has</text><text start="173.409" dur="7.021">this like automatic gain feature in it</text><text start="175.989" dur="7.59">that will adjust the signal out such</text><text start="180.43" dur="6">that the highest voltage and the signal</text><text start="183.579" dur="4.44">out is always roughly the same which is</text><text start="186.43" dur="3.839">actually really useful if you&amp;#39;re trying</text><text start="188.019" dur="4.17">to transmit data with one of these but</text><text start="190.269" dur="4.021">if you&amp;#39;re just trying to detect whether</text><text start="192.189" dur="3.871">something is on or off it&amp;#39;s really not</text><text start="194.29" dur="4.589">very useful because that means that it</text><text start="196.06" dur="5.28">amplifies your noise and it looks at</text><text start="198.879" dur="4.08">your noises as loud as your signal</text><text start="201.34" dur="3.86">although it&amp;#39;s different than your signal</text><text start="202.959" dur="4.56">and that&amp;#39;s how we have to actually</text><text start="205.2" dur="5.259">determine whether or not the signal is</text><text start="207.519" dur="5.911">being transmitted so when the foot pedal</text><text start="210.459" dur="5.131">is depressed the signal that we get out</text><text start="213.43" dur="4.41">of this receiver is kind of a noisier</text><text start="215.59" dur="4.829">version of what we sent in it&amp;#39;s this</text><text start="217.84" dur="4.53">same square wave but of course because</text><text start="220.419" dur="3.63">we&amp;#39;ve transmitted it and received it and</text><text start="222.37" dur="4.53">it&amp;#39;s gone through a handful of stuff</text><text start="224.049" dur="5.34">it&amp;#39;s a little maybe wavy at the edges</text><text start="226.9" dur="4.8">I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure how wavy because I</text><text start="229.389" dur="6.18">didn&amp;#39;t actually have a an oscilloscope</text><text start="231.7" dur="5.789">on hand to analyze these signals instead</text><text start="235.569" dur="3.961">I was trying to use an FFT app on my</text><text start="237.489" dur="4.56">phone and play all these signals through</text><text start="239.53" dur="4.5">a speaker which sounds really horrible</text><text start="242.049" dur="6.451">but it actually kind of worked to do</text><text start="244.03" dur="6.84">rough analysis so I but when you have</text><text start="248.5" dur="6.389">this signal this is what I&amp;#39;m assuming it</text><text start="250.87" dur="6">looks like and the the noise is because</text><text start="254.889" dur="5.52">it is amplified by this auto gain</text><text start="256.87" dur="5.28">feature it&amp;#39;s on par here so it goes the</text><text start="260.409" dur="3.57">the highest extent is going to be about</text><text start="262.15" dur="3.03">the same and I don&amp;#39;t know exactly what</text><text start="263.979" dur="3.511">it looks like but you know maybe it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="265.18" dur="6.479">sort of a random looking thing like that</text><text start="267.49" dur="6.299">and spouts as tall so this goes between</text><text start="271.659" dur="3.811">zero volts and whatever the max is and</text><text start="273.789" dur="3.421">this goes between zero volts and</text><text start="275.47" dur="4.729">whatever the max is of the auto gain</text><text start="277.21" dur="6">which means that you can&amp;#39;t just take the</text><text start="280.199" dur="5.65">peak voltage and say is it on if the</text><text start="283.21" dur="6.449">peak voltage is above some level so I</text><text start="285.849" dur="6.091">use what is really two stages of really</text><text start="289.659" dur="5.641">simple analysis first a low-pass filter</text><text start="291.94" dur="6.33">and second a trim pot that is just there</text><text start="295.3" dur="5.25">to put in a tunable attenuation of the</text><text start="298.27" dur="3.99">signal before sending it into a</text><text start="300.55" dur="4.77">transistor which is</text><text start="302.26" dur="6.6">functioning as a pure switch to turn on</text><text start="305.32" dur="7.02">the buzzer now as soon as this signal</text><text start="308.86" dur="5.55">goes through the low-pass filter what</text><text start="312.34" dur="3.81">happens is that this signal is when it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="314.41" dur="3.99">high it&amp;#39;s trying to charge this</text><text start="316.15" dur="4.17">capacitor and when it&amp;#39;s low it&amp;#39;s trying</text><text start="318.4" dur="3.57">to discharge this capacitor of course</text><text start="320.32" dur="4.95">through this resistor that slows it down</text><text start="321.97" dur="5.49">a little bit so when you have a really</text><text start="325.27" dur="5.37">slow signal like this that&amp;#39;s like 70</text><text start="327.46" dur="5.13">Hertz you actually have time to charge</text><text start="330.64" dur="4.77">and discharge the capacitor so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="332.59" dur="4.95">passing the low-frequency signals that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="335.41" dur="4.86">why it&amp;#39;s a low pass filter so you get</text><text start="337.54" dur="4.2">something down here and then it starts</text><text start="340.27" dur="3.33">to charge the capacitor and it gets</text><text start="341.74" dur="4.47">there slowly but it does get there and</text><text start="343.6" dur="7.14">then when you drop low it gets there</text><text start="346.21" dur="7.41">slowly but it does get there and you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="350.74" dur="4.86">you&amp;#39;ll pass a version of that signal and</text><text start="353.62" dur="3.87">it will go all the way high and it will</text><text start="355.6" dur="4.95">go all the way low now when you try to</text><text start="357.49" dur="5.28">pass the noise the noise level is the</text><text start="360.55" dur="6.03">noise signal that&amp;#39;s a thing the noise</text><text start="362.77" dur="6.15">signal is fluctuating so quickly that it</text><text start="366.58" dur="4.38">doesn&amp;#39;t have time to ever fully charge</text><text start="368.92" dur="4.77">or discharge the capacitor so it</text><text start="370.96" dur="4.86">basically just smooths this off and you</text><text start="373.69" dur="5.04">end up with a nearly constant voltage</text><text start="375.82" dur="7.62">that is representative of the average</text><text start="378.73" dur="6.12">voltage of the noise now the average of</text><text start="383.44" dur="3.54">both of these signals is going to be</text><text start="384.85" dur="3.72">almost the same the duty cycle this is a</text><text start="386.98" dur="3.42">little over fifty percent but I have no</text><text start="388.57" dur="3.66">idea what the duty cycle of the noise is</text><text start="390.4" dur="6.57">so I couldn&amp;#39;t really do anything with</text><text start="392.23" dur="9.21">that now this level is actually still</text><text start="396.97" dur="6.66">above zero because this is a complete DC</text><text start="401.44" dur="3.81">circuit so if this this is my axis here</text><text start="403.63" dur="3.45">so this is zero volts this is whatever</text><text start="405.25" dur="6.21">the maximum voltage is that it achieves</text><text start="407.08" dur="5.97">over here is on the same axis I this is</text><text start="411.46" dur="3.45">going to be if this is like three volts</text><text start="413.05" dur="4.53">this is like a volt and a half which</text><text start="414.91" dur="4.8">means that it&amp;#39;s still too much and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="417.58" dur="4.38">always going to turn on this transistor</text><text start="419.71" dur="4.68">now the transistor turns on whenever</text><text start="421.96" dur="4.02">there&amp;#39;s a voltage applied to the base of</text><text start="424.39" dur="2.88">more than about point seven I think I</text><text start="425.98" dur="2.94">actually measured this one it was like</text><text start="427.27" dur="4.98">point six eight or something like that</text><text start="428.92" dur="5.95">but very close two point seven that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="432.25" dur="4.39">rule of thumb so we need to draw</text><text start="434.87" dur="3.93">this signal down to where it is just</text><text start="436.64" dur="3.72">below that threshold and that&amp;#39;s what I</text><text start="438.8" dur="3.63">do with this trim pot right here this is</text><text start="440.36" dur="3.63">like the simplest voltage divider you</text><text start="442.43" dur="4.08">can get and the best thing is that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="443.99" dur="7.47">on a screw driver Bob so you can adjust</text><text start="446.51" dur="6.78">it and that will drop this down if you</text><text start="451.46" dur="3.69">assume for the sake of the drawing that</text><text start="453.29" dur="3.93">this is cutting it in half so it&amp;#39;s a 1k</text><text start="455.15" dur="5.16">trim pot if you&amp;#39;ve got 500 ohms above</text><text start="457.22" dur="5.13">and 500 ohms below then this is going to</text><text start="460.31" dur="5.46">go from about 1 on the grid to about a</text><text start="462.35" dur="6.21">half on the grid right here which is say</text><text start="465.77" dur="6.75">that&amp;#39;s below the threshold that we need</text><text start="468.56" dur="6.39">to turn on the buzzer now when the</text><text start="472.52" dur="3.93">signal goes through that same thing it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="474.95" dur="3.09">going to get cut down so it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="476.45" dur="5.01">be about zero and then it&amp;#39;s going to go</text><text start="478.04" dur="5.79">up to about 1 and then it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="481.46" dur="7.2">drop down to about zero then it&amp;#39;s going</text><text start="483.83" dur="6.9">to go up to about one and it&amp;#39;s got the</text><text start="488.66" dur="7.68">same threshold which means that for a</text><text start="490.73" dur="7.5">portion of the actual signal the value</text><text start="496.34" dur="4.62">the voltage that we&amp;#39;re sending into the</text><text start="498.23" dur="5.67">base of the transistor is actually above</text><text start="500.96" dur="4.53">the transistors turn on voltage which</text><text start="503.9" dur="3.69">means that the transistor is going to</text><text start="505.49" dur="4.23">turn on it&amp;#39;s going to conduct and we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="507.59" dur="3.9">going to turn on the buzzer and because</text><text start="509.72" dur="3.36">DC buzzers are really weird and they&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="511.49" dur="3.81">got some internal circuitry that makes</text><text start="513.08" dur="4.47">them oscillate it actually has enough</text><text start="515.3" dur="4.62">built in capacitance that it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="517.55" dur="7.08">sound like it stays on it&amp;#39;s not going to</text><text start="519.92" dur="7.05">go click-click-click at 70 Hertz it</text><text start="524.63" dur="4.62">actually stays on reasonably well so</text><text start="526.97" dur="4.71">that&amp;#39;s kind of an afterthought but it</text><text start="529.25" dur="5.25">still would work just fine if it didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="531.68" dur="4.71">stay on all that time but I that&amp;#39;s how</text><text start="534.5" dur="3.96">this particular instance worked out so</text><text start="536.39" dur="4.47">when you are trent when you&amp;#39;re reading</text><text start="538.46" dur="5.28">noise it averages out and then it</text><text start="540.86" dur="4.8">divides that down and that divided</text><text start="543.74" dur="4.65">average turns out to be below the</text><text start="545.66" dur="5.52">threshold for turn on and when you have</text><text start="548.39" dur="5.19">the actual signal going through for a</text><text start="551.18" dur="4.92">portion of that signal this capacitor</text><text start="553.58" dur="4.26">has time to fully charge which means</text><text start="556.1" dur="3.9">that even after you put it through the</text><text start="557.84" dur="4.44">voltage divider it&amp;#39;s going to be above</text><text start="560" dur="5.04">the turn-on threshold of the transistor</text><text start="562.28" dur="4.47">and you&amp;#39;re going to get noise and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="565.04" dur="3.25">basically how this thing can tell</text><text start="566.75" dur="3.97">whether you&amp;#39;re sending</text><text start="568.29" dur="3.78">a signal or whether the foot pedal isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="570.72" dur="5.07">depressed and it&amp;#39;s picking up background</text><text start="572.07" dur="5.819">and that was a reasonably hard thing to</text><text start="575.79" dur="5.69">figure out but the circuit to do it in</text><text start="577.889" dur="3.591">the end is actually extremely simple</text></transcript>
