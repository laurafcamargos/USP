not</text><text start="5.12" dur="3.559">all maps are created equal borders will</text><text start="6.72" dur="3.64">differ depending on who you got that map</text><text start="8.679" dur="3.681">from so if individuals disagree then</text><text start="10.36" dur="3.319">surely a committee will save the day go</text><text start="12.36" dur="2.72">to the United Nations find the room</text><text start="13.679" dur="3.36">where the countries sit each with a</text><text start="15.08" dur="4.08">little name tag start counting and get</text><text start="17.039" dur="3.801">an answer now of course countries come</text><text start="19.16" dur="4.84">and countries go but at the time this</text><text start="20.84" dur="4.759">video was made the answer is 193 fastest</text><text start="24" dur="3.24">video ever right except you know this</text><text start="25.599" dur="3.481">isn&amp;#39;t over the United Nations list is</text><text start="27.24" dur="3.68">less a complete class roster than a club</text><text start="29.08" dur="3.679">membership that doesn&amp;#39;t include everyone</text><text start="30.92" dur="3.4">take Vatican City who is a country but</text><text start="32.759" dur="3.32">is too cool for school when it comes to</text><text start="34.32" dur="3.68">being a member of the United Nations and</text><text start="36.079" dur="3.401">while Vatican City&amp;#39;s exact situation is</text><text start="38" dur="3.039">complicated he&amp;#39;s straightforward</text><text start="39.48" dur="3.8">compared to other non-united nations</text><text start="41.039" dur="4.081">countries or places the terminology is</text><text start="43.28" dur="3.84">going to have to be a bit unclear here</text><text start="45.12" dur="3.84">take Kosovo who wants to join the UN</text><text start="47.12" dur="3.68">Club but membership requires none of</text><text start="48.96" dur="3.2">these five countries to reject you and</text><text start="50.8" dur="3.16">while the United States United Kingdom</text><text start="52.16" dur="3.28">and France think Kosovo is a country</text><text start="53.96" dur="3.56">Russia and China think she&amp;#39;s just a</text><text start="55.44" dur="3.959">rebellious part of Serbia and so veto</text><text start="57.52" dur="3.4">her membership as for everyone else just</text><text start="59.399" dur="3.601">over half recognize Kosovo as</text><text start="60.92" dur="3.559">independent and Kosovo adorably has a</text><text start="63" dur="3.439">website where she thanks each one in</text><text start="64.479" dur="3.721">their own language but Kosovo is not the</text><text start="66.439" dur="3.201">only other place that wants to be</text><text start="68.2" dur="3.52">considered a real country there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="69.64" dur="4.32">transnistria the nagoro kabak Republic</text><text start="71.72" dur="4.64">abazia and South otia which might or</text><text start="73.96" dur="4.76">might not be part of mdova azerbajan or</text><text start="76.36" dur="4.68">Georgia depending on who you ask two of</text><text start="78.72" dur="4.24">these countries no UN member recognize</text><text start="81.04" dur="4.2">as countries and the other two have only</text><text start="82.96" dur="4.64">five supporters though all four of these</text><text start="85.24" dur="4.08">places recognize each other as countries</text><text start="87.6" dur="3.4">there&amp;#39;s also the sari Arab Democratic</text><text start="89.32" dur="3.439">Republic and Northern Cyprus each with</text><text start="91" dur="3.799">their own supporters at this point you</text><text start="92.759" dur="4.04">might be thinking okay seriously what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="94.799" dur="4.121">the deal I don&amp;#39;t care who these guys</text><text start="96.799" dur="4.121">think are countries are these places</text><text start="98.92" dur="3.72">countries or not if I fly to one for a</text><text start="100.92" dur="4.6">holiday will it look like a country when</text><text start="102.64" dur="4.56">I get there the answer is maybe these</text><text start="105.52" dur="3.12">countries are all autonomous to some</text><text start="107.2" dur="3.519">extent with governments that issue</text><text start="108.64" dur="4.04">passports though these may be of rather</text><text start="110.719" dur="3.68">limited use and depending on which ones</text><text start="112.68" dur="3.92">you&amp;#39;re visiting they may have more or</text><text start="114.399" dur="4.36">less control of the territory they claim</text><text start="116.6" dur="4.6">as theirs you won&amp;#39;t always find a clear</text><text start="118.759" dur="4.601">border what makes many of these places</text><text start="121.2" dur="4.08">fuzzy is that they&amp;#39;re usually born of</text><text start="123.36" dur="3.28">conflict in the recentish past that</text><text start="125.28" dur="3">answer is probably less helpful than you</text><text start="126.64" dur="3.44">want so think of it like this while the</text><text start="128.28" dur="4.72">United States is clearly a country now</text><text start="130.08" dur="4.64">in 1776 not so much then she was just an</text><text start="133" dur="3.44">idea in the minds of Rebel scum she</text><text start="134.72" dur="3.56">wasn&amp;#39;t recognized as a country instantly</text><text start="136.44" dur="3.68">and without diplomatic effort to change</text><text start="138.28" dur="3.72">that Young America would never have made</text><text start="140.12" dur="3.64">it on her own much like what happened a</text><text start="142" dur="3.64">century later when she got her own Rebel</text><text start="143.76" dur="4.559">who unlike elder sister failed in the</text><text start="145.64" dur="4.28">diplomacy department so yeah and so it</text><text start="148.319" dur="3.081">goes today with many of the Maybe</text><text start="149.92" dur="3.039">countries in the world maybe their</text><text start="151.4" dur="3.36">future United States and maybe their</text><text start="152.959" dur="3.601">future confederacies but in the moment</text><text start="154.76" dur="3.8">it&amp;#39;s hard to say because these things</text><text start="156.56" dur="4.16">can take decades to settle by the way</text><text start="158.56" dur="3.679">these maybe countries are super awkward</text><text start="160.72" dur="2.96">for countries to deal with while you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="162.239" dur="2.761">a tiny island nation might not want to</text><text start="163.68" dur="3">get involved in the Affairs of distant</text><text start="165" dur="3.76">lands you still have to decide to send a</text><text start="166.68" dur="4">diplomat or not meaning even in action</text><text start="168.76" dur="3.839">forces you to pick a side in every</text><text start="170.68" dur="4.12">territorial Skirmish in the world a</text><text start="172.599" dur="5.321">notably awkward case being Taiwan or</text><text start="174.8" dur="5.24">sorry Chinese Taipei which is totally</text><text start="177.92" dur="5.72">part of China and no one would ever</text><text start="180.04" dur="5.4">think otherwise is China gone okay by</text><text start="183.64" dur="3.519">any reasonable definition Taiwan is a</text><text start="185.44" dur="3.6">separate country and has been for years</text><text start="187.159" dur="3.961">but China won&amp;#39;t let go and insists you</text><text start="189.04" dur="3.8">call her Chinese Taipei and don&amp;#39;t forget</text><text start="191.12" dur="3.44">who makes all your clothing and utensils</text><text start="192.84" dur="3.2">and phones and computers and everything</text><text start="194.56" dur="3.399">so almost all countries including the</text><text start="196.04" dur="3.36">Mighty United States play along even</text><text start="197.959" dur="3.161">though they unofficially acknowledge</text><text start="199.4" dur="3.199">taiwan&amp;#39;s Independence and do things that</text><text start="201.12" dur="3.199">wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense otherwise like</text><text start="202.599" dur="4.28">sending aircraft carriers to protect one</text><text start="204.319" dur="3.92">part of China from Another Part Of China</text><text start="206.879" dur="2.92">thus the innocent question how many</text><text start="208.239" dur="3.481">countries has led us straight to a big</text><text start="209.799" dur="3.241">World War III press here to start button</text><text start="211.72" dur="5.2">which is getting depressing so let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="213.04" dur="6.88">move on to oh</text><text

have a</text><text start="223.439" dur="4.121">disinterested view of the countries</text><text start="224.92" dur="5.8">below how many are there Olympics</text><text start="227.56" dur="5.039">204 huh so Olympics is a bit special she</text><text start="230.72" dur="3.239">defines Puerto Rico as a country even</text><text start="232.599" dur="3.041">though it&amp;#39;s unambiguously part of the</text><text start="233.959" dur="3.521">United States as well as Bermuda and</text><text start="235.64" dur="3.239">Aruba which are connected to the UK and</text><text start="237.48" dur="3.08">the Netherlands along with a bunch of</text><text start="238.879" dur="3.92">other places that are happy to play in</text><text start="240.56" dur="4.039">her Olympic Games as Nations but make no</text><text start="242.799" dur="3.36">claims to Independence presumably</text><text start="244.599" dur="3.441">Olympics includes these to bump up the</text><text start="246.159" dur="3.561">number so she can say more than 200</text><text start="248.04" dur="3.36">countries compete though even her</text><text start="249.72" dur="3.68">inflated list doesn&amp;#39;t include Vatican</text><text start="251.4" dur="3.8">City because given his demographics</text><text start="253.4" dur="3.6">divine intervention would be required to</text><text start="255.2" dur="3.36">take home a gold and Vatican City brings</text><text start="257" dur="2.919">us right back to the core of the</text><text start="258.56" dur="3.04">difficulty with this question a</text><text start="259.919" dur="3.441">consistent definition of country is</text><text start="261.6" dur="3.92">impossible because your checklist needs</text><text start="263.36" dur="3.559">to include both Vatican City the least</text><text start="265.52" dur="3.44">country-like country that&amp;#39;s still a</text><text start="266.919" dur="3.961">country and also exclude the anti-</text><text

from previous episodes the</text><text start="274.68" dur="4.04">seemingly endless territories which look</text><text start="276.84" dur="3.919">and act like independent countries but</text><text start="278.72" dur="3.56">just sort of aren&amp;#39;t and this isn&amp;#39;t even</text><text start="280.759" dur="3.801">bringing up the various Nutters who</text><text start="282.28"

dur="3.481">question how many countries for the</text><text start="293.08" dur="4.72">foreseeable future is probably to say</text><text start="295.24" dur="4.48">around 200 and leave it at that an</text><text start="297.8" dur="3.92">answer with more significant figures in</text><text start="299.72" dur="4.08">implies more agreement than there really</text><text start="301.72" dur="4.36">is
