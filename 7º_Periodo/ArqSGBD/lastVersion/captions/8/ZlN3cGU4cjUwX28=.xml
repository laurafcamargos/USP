exactly how</text><text start="16.8" dur="4.319">i use mine so let me show you the</text><text start="18.88" dur="4.479">specifics and then you can see if this</text><text start="21.119" dur="4.641">journal exactly or just the system in</text><text start="23.359" dur="4">general on anything might work for you</text><text start="25.76" dur="4.16">rather than start at the beginning which</text><text start="27.359" dur="4.481">contains the actual theme part i usually</text><text start="29.92" dur="4.159">start at the back with these boxes and</text><text start="31.84" dur="4.719">circles which are daily trackers of what</text><text start="34.079" dur="4.561">you want to improve upon or as is often</text><text start="36.559" dur="4.401">the case with me at least what you want</text><text start="38.64" dur="4.4">to be more consistent about so this is</text><text start="40.96" dur="3.759">where what you want to track happens but</text><text start="43.04" dur="3.359">you don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s on your mind</text><text start="44.719" dur="3.52">before you think about it so there are</text><text start="46.399" dur="3.84">these blank pages next door to</text><text start="48.239" dur="4.32">brainstorm on what you might want to</text><text start="50.239" dur="4.32">improve and test out how to phrase what</text><text start="52.559" dur="3.68">to put in the daily tracker slots</text><text start="54.559" dur="3.761">personally i find the process of</text><text start="56.239" dur="4.48">thinking about what needs to be improved</text><text start="58.32" dur="4.239">or changed or constantified one of the</text><text start="60.719" dur="4.16">most directly helpful parts of the</text><text start="62.559" dur="4.56">process identifying vague feelings of</text><text start="64.879" dur="4.481">dissatisfaction and turning them into</text><text start="67.119" dur="4.561">actionable tractionable checklistable</text><text start="69.36" dur="4.16">items for me the brainstorm pages</text><text start="71.68" dur="4.56">usually end up with the big four that</text><text start="73.52" dur="4.72">can go wrong sleep exercise diet work</text><text start="76.24" dur="4">plus a few other things on my mind at</text><text start="78.24" dur="4.08">the time for example i realized over the</text><text start="80.24" dur="4.48">past couple of years i&amp;#39;ve gotten</text><text start="82.32" dur="4">really terrible at human communications</text><text start="84.72" dur="4.64">i mean i&amp;#39;ve always been bad at</text><text start="86.32" dur="5.759">responding to messages but it&amp;#39;s at new</text><text start="89.36" dur="5.04">abysmal lows next the idea is to</text><text start="92.079" dur="4.641">translate these pages into trackable</text><text start="94.4" dur="4.48">items for these pages i think about the</text><text start="96.72" dur="4.24">list as top down in order of importance</text><text start="98.88" dur="4.64">i&amp;#39;m not going to be successful at all</text><text start="100.96" dur="4.72">things at all times so a rank ordered</text><text start="103.52" dur="4.16">list is helpful when things aren&amp;#39;t going</text><text start="105.68" dur="3.6">great the circles are for filling in</text><text start="107.68" dur="3.28">progress and they have a little line in</text><text start="109.28" dur="3.92">them so you can give yourself partial</text><text start="110.96" dur="5.04">credit if you want and i really</text><text start="113.2" dur="5.04">recommend setting easy peasy partial</text><text start="116" dur="5.759">credit example for writing i set the</text><text start="118.24" dur="5.919">hilariously low write anything at all as</text><text start="121.759" dur="7">partial credit this is motivation to not</text><text start="124.159" dur="4.6">completely bounce off a day&amp;#39;s work</text><text start="129.2" dur="5.039">the full credit is a more reasonable but</text><text start="131.52" dur="4.64">still easy two full writing sessions in</text><text start="134.239" dur="3.841">a day for exercise partial credit is</text><text start="136.16" dur="3.92">five minutes of strength shortly after</text><text start="138.08" dur="3.92">waking up and the full credit is 20</text><text start="140.08" dur="4.08">minutes later and what i&amp;#39;ve been toying</text><text start="142" dur="4.4">with so far about that communications</text><text start="144.16" dur="5.2">problem is to give myself partial credit</text><text start="146.4" dur="5.919">for something like reply to one message</text><text start="149.36" dur="4.08">from anyone today which is something i</text><text start="152.319" dur="3.28">currently</text><text start="153.44" dur="4.4">frequently fail to do that might sound</text><text start="155.599" dur="4.401">like a comically low threshold depending</text><text start="157.84" dur="4.64">on what your life is like but i think it</text><text start="160" dur="4.319">also communicates just how bad i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="162.48" dur="3.6">gotten that communication i actually</text><text start="164.319" dur="3.761">suspect this is still going to be quite</text><text start="166.08" dur="4.08">hard for me questions added i then fill</text><text start="168.08" dur="3.68">in the circles as i go and be sure to</text><text start="170.16" dur="3.439">look at it all over at the end of the</text><text start="171.76" dur="3.68">day you can track the dates at the top</text><text start="173.599" dur="3.681">and if you really want count up the</text><text start="175.44" dur="4.159">circle sections for bonus points if you</text><text start="177.28" dur="4.16">like but i find the circles themselves</text><text start="179.599" dur="3.36">pleasingly visual enough one of the</text><text start="181.44" dur="3.76">really helpful things about having a</text><text start="182.959" dur="3.841">physical journal is to act as a reminder</text><text start="185.2" dur="3.679">and nudge at the end of the day that</text><text start="186.8" dur="4.4">you&amp;#39;re going to want to see more circles</text><text start="188.879" dur="4.481">filled in than not alright so that&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="191.2" dur="5.28">daily trackers but there are also a lot</text><text start="193.36" dur="4.72">of pages like this so how do i use these</text><text start="196.48" dur="2.96">this is the main part of the theme</text><text start="198.08" dur="3.519">system journal and it&amp;#39;s the most</text><text start="199.44" dur="3.76">flexible and open-ended i use this at</text><text start="201.599" dur="3.841">the start of the day writing down where</text><text start="203.2" dur="4.24">i am in the header and the top two boxes</text><text start="205.44" dur="4.24">to write two things i&amp;#39;m grateful for</text><text start="207.44" dur="4.48">which i know exactly how that sounds but</text><text start="209.68" dur="4">it really is frustrating how effective</text><text start="211.92" dur="3.28">this is at mood elevation i really</text><text start="213.68" dur="3.199">should make a whole other video about</text><text start="215.2" dur="3.84">gratitude journaling at some point but</text><text start="216.879" dur="4.64">for now i&amp;#39;ll just say the trick is to be</text><text start="219.04" dur="4.64">really specific so don&amp;#39;t write i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="221.519" dur="5.121">grateful for my family write something</text><text start="223.68" dur="4.8">exactly about one person in particular</text><text start="226.64" dur="3.44">and the real pro trick if you&amp;#39;re using</text><text start="228.48" dur="3.839">the journal when you&amp;#39;re feeling down is</text><text start="230.08" dur="4.64">to leave this bottom box empty until the</text><text start="232.319" dur="4.48">end of the day to write in one thing</text><text start="234.72" dur="3.76">that went well during the day this</text><text start="236.799" dur="3.921">forces your brain to start to pay</text><text start="238.48" dur="4.319">attention to all the good things in life</text><text start="240.72" dur="3.76">because it has to remember to save one</text><text start="242.799" dur="3.52">for later anyway most of the time i</text><text start="244.48" dur="3.839">don&amp;#39;t feel the need for that extra step</text><text start="246.319" dur="4.721">so i use the bottom box as a place to</text><text start="248.319" dur="4.881">write the one absolutely critical action</text><text start="251.04" dur="3.759">item for the day and the big box in the</text><text start="253.2" dur="3.36">middle for me is where i write down</text><text start="254.799" dur="4">whatever is on my mind in the morning</text><text start="256.56" dur="4.239">this box is by far the least actionable</text><text start="258.799" dur="3.84">part in some ways though it helps over</text><text start="260.799" dur="3.201">time to see what are reoccurring</text><text start="262.639" dur="3.12">patterns that you might want to</text><text start="264" dur="3.919">incorporate into future tracking</text><text start="265.759" dur="4.561">questions or into an overarching theme</text><text start="267.919" dur="4.321">itself which brings me to the theme part</text><text start="270.32" dur="4.24">of the theme system journal where you</text><text start="272.24" dur="3.84">can set a high level theme for the year</text><text start="274.56" dur="4">or the season like year of</text><text start="276.08" dur="4.8">intentionality or the spring of novelty</text><text start="278.56" dur="4.16">set ideal outcomes you&amp;#39;d like to aim for</text><text start="280.88" dur="4.16">and align your journaling and questions</text><text start="282.72" dur="4.479">at the back toward that again like any</text><text start="285.04" dur="4.879">single part it&amp;#39;s not necessary or</text><text start="287.199" dur="4.881">required to use it exactly like this</text><text start="289.919" dur="4">though this is the one place where there</text><text start="292.08" dur="3.839">are labels because it&amp;#39;s a strong</text><text start="293.919" dur="4.161">recommendation a lot of work has gone</text><text start="295.919" dur="4.961">into making this journal the absolute</text><text start="298.08" dur="5.119">finest it can be i would love if any of</text><text start="300.88" dur="4.64">this sounded helpful for you to buy one</text><text start="303.199" dur="5.44">and give it a try though i also want to</text><text start="305.52" dur="5.04">be clear you don&amp;#39;t have to buy this i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="308.639" dur="3.681">shown you all the parts there aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="310.56" dur="4.16">secrets paywalled in the physical</text><text start="312.32" dur="4.879">product so you can just do this on your</text><text start="314.72" dur="4.319">own and if because of this video you try</text><text

i&amp;#39;ll just say that if you</text><text start="323.52" dur="4.48">do want to have a nice physical object</text><text start="326.08" dur="4.24">that has been lovingly designed and</text><text start="328" dur="4.4">tweaked over the years i cannot tell you</text><text start="330.32" dur="4.4">how much time was spent making sure the</text><text start="332.4" dur="4">edges of this progress tab
