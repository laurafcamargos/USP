start="24.08" dur="5.85">terror face you think of your science</text><text start="26" dur="5.82">and I get game theory and economics and</text><text start="29.93" dur="4.379">there are several reasons so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="31.82" dur="5.85">interested in this interface one is a</text><text start="34.309" dur="6.421">very practical reason and that&amp;#39;s that a</text><text start="37.67" dur="6.99">lot of human economic activity is</text><text start="40.73" dur="10.969">happening online on computation of</text><text start="44.66" dur="11.16">platforms so you need some handle to</text><text start="51.699" dur="6.161">design these platforms in a way that</text><text start="55.82" dur="7.89">takes into account besides the</text><text start="57.86" dur="8.25">computational issues also the strategic</text><text start="63.71" dur="4.83">an incentive issues so that&amp;#39;s a very</text><text start="66.11" dur="5.4">fact of reason why this interface is</text><text start="68.54" dur="4.98">important especially when you know a lot</text><text start="71.51" dur="4.32">of the economic activities up in your</text><text start="73.52" dur="4.29">line but there&amp;#39;s also a deeper</text><text start="75.83" dur="5.399">philosophical reason why this is</text><text start="77.81" dur="4.98">important and that relates to the</text><text start="81.229" dur="3.481">foundations of game theory in economics</text><text start="82.79" dur="5.13">which have to do with bounded</text><text start="84.71" dur="5.75">rationality when you make predictions</text><text start="87.92" dur="6.329">about what humans in a strategic</text><text start="90.46" dur="5.32">scenario are going to be doing you</text><text start="94.249" dur="4.29">should also take into account that</text><text start="95.78" dur="6.57">humans and are not infinitely rational</text><text start="98.539" dur="6.33">and in particular they have a</text><text start="102.35" dur="5.909">computational constraints in what</text><text start="104.869" dur="7.25">they&amp;#39;re able to think about in a finite</text><text start="108.259" dur="8.85">amount of time so you really have to</text><text start="112.119" dur="8.051">inject into your game theoretic and</text><text start="117.109" dur="6.47">economic approach to analyzing behavior</text><text start="120.17" dur="5.67">also the computational barriers that</text><text start="123.579" dur="5.411">humans are going to be facing when</text><text start="125.84" dur="5.9">they&amp;#39;re making decisions so that&amp;#39;s yet</text><text start="128.99" dur="6.87">another reason why this interface is</text><text start="131.74" dur="5.68">very interesting lastly there are very</text><text start="135.86" dur="4.92">interesting mathematics and very</text><text start="137.42" dur="5.31">interesting computational questions that</text><text start="140.78" dur="5.4">arise once you start thinking about our</text><text start="142.73" dur="4.25">interaction that motivates that it</text><text start="146.18" dur="3.87">offends</text><text start="146.98" dur="3.07">[Music]</text><text start="153.47" dur="4.26">Nash equilibrium is a mathematical</text><text start="155.48" dur="5.7">theory whose goal is to characterize</text><text start="157.73" dur="9.15">what happens in now when strategic</text><text start="161.18" dur="11.58">individuals interact in a game or in a</text><text start="166.88" dur="8.99">very general notion of what a game is</text><text start="172.76" dur="6.93">which is basically a strategic</text><text start="175.87" dur="7.9">interaction roughly speaking a Nash</text><text start="179.69" dur="7.83">equilibrium is a strategy for every</text><text start="183.77" dur="7.59">individual participating in that</text><text start="187.52" dur="6.749">interaction with with the probability</text><text start="191.36" dur="4.849">that given what the other players but</text><text start="194.269" dur="5.551">the other individuals are doing a</text><text start="196.209" dur="8.5">non-player unilaterally you can improve</text><text start="199.82" dur="7.47">his position by updating a strategy so</text><text start="204.709" dur="4.591">that&amp;#39;s a natural people it&amp;#39;s a choice of</text><text start="207.29" dur="6.71">strategy for every participant so that</text><text start="209.3" dur="6.9">everybody is happy at least they can all</text><text start="214" dur="4.45">in the sense that they cannot even</text><text start="216.2" dur="4.77">lather and improve their situation by</text><text start="218.45" dur="4.86">changing their strategy it could be that</text><text start="220.97" dur="6.72">you know where some global mood can make</text><text start="223.31" dur="6.82">everybody happy but every individual</text><text start="227.69" dur="5.62">move cannot</text><text start="230.13" dur="6.26">so what my work with the Goldberg and</text><text start="233.31" dur="7.1">probably tree house sold is that when</text><text start="236.39" dur="7.45">game is very complex when a strategic</text><text start="240.41" dur="4.48">situation becomes very complex it has a</text><text start="243.84" dur="5.37">lot of moving parts</text><text start="244.89" dur="7.89">I love notes for the players to attune</text><text start="249.21" dur="6.39">to update their strategies then it may</text><text start="252.78" dur="6.42">be computationally really hard for the</text><text start="255.6" dur="7.35">players to actually arrive at Nash</text><text start="259.2" dur="8.91">equilibria which philosophically implies</text><text start="262.95" dur="8.61">that if agents are computationally</text><text start="268.11" dur="5.61">bounded which they are they will</text><text start="271.56" dur="5.67">actually not be able to discover a Nash</text><text start="273.72" dur="5.82">equilibria in particular in this case</text><text start="277.23" dur="5.69">the predictions of Nash equilibria</text><text start="279.54" dur="5.67">should not be trusted as you
