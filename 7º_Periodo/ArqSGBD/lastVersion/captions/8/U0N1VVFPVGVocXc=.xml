dur="4.08">you could remove material until you had</text><text start="187.92" dur="4.08">a smooth surface for example with</text><text start="189.76" dur="4.96">sandpaper but that still leaves a

conform to the layer lines on one</text><text start="199.76" dur="4.96">side and form an extremely smooth</text><text start="201.92" dur="4.959">surface on the other all by itself it</text><text

maybe</text><text start="262.96" dur="4.72">that&amp;#39;ll be worth trying in the future</text><text start="265.28" dur="4.72">after the epoxy is mixed you basically</text><text start="267.68"

resin naturally</text><text start="304.4" dur="4.88">smooths out to minimize its own surface</text><text start="307.039" dur="4.72">area the upshot of this is that we can</text><text start="309.28" dur="5.199">use it to take jagged edges and make</text><text start="311.759" dur="4.88">them round however these thick coats</text><text start="314.479" dur="5.201">mean that i do get some issues with</text><text start="316.639" dur="5.521">flowing resin so for large parts i</text><text start="319.68" dur="4.88">actually started slowly spinning them</text><text start="322.16" dur="4.479">while

will be more on that in</text><text start="334.32" dur="4.56">the future now that the parts that i</text><text start="336.4" dur="4.799">want to make into mirrors are all</text><text start="338.88" dur="4.72">epoxy coated and they have a smooth</text><text start="341.199" dur="4.401">surface the next step is the really fun</text><text start="343.6" dur="4">part the chemical silvering these are</text><text start="345.6" dur="3.84">going to be first surface mirrors</text><text start="347.6" dur="4.08">whereas your bathroom mirror is actually</text><text start="349.44" dur="4.72">a second surface mirror like i said</text><text start="351.68" dur="5.12">before for a mirror to work at all you</text><text start="354.16" dur="5.28">need a surface a boundary between two</text><text start="356.8" dur="5.6">different materials and if that critical</text><text start="359.44" dur="4.96">interface is between the metal film and</text><text start="362.4" dur="4.4">air then you&amp;#39;ve got yourself a first</text><text start="364.4" dur="4.88">surface mirror the light bounces off of</text><text start="366.8" dur="4.399">the first surface in general though if</text><text start="369.28" dur="4.96">you take a flat surface and coat it with</text><text start="371.199" dur="6.72">metal that film is really really easy to</text><text start="374.24" dur="5.76">damage or dent or chemically degrade so</text><text start="377.919" dur="4.321">outside of really weird applications</text><text start="380" dur="4.479">like telescope mirrors or optics for</text><text start="382.24" dur="4.64">physics experiments that&amp;#39;s really not</text><text start="384.479" dur="5.121">done instead the metal is applied to the</text><text start="386.88" dur="4.8">back of a sheet of extremely flat glass</text><text start="389.6" dur="4.8">which means that incoming light passes</text><text start="391.68" dur="5.44">through the air glass boundary bounces</text><text start="394.4" dur="4.56">off of the glass metal boundary and then</text><text start="397.12" dur="4.48">goes through the glass air boundary</text><text start="398.96" dur="4.64">again before reaching your eye but if</text><text start="401.6" dur="3.2">you have a second surface mirror you can</text><text start="403.6" dur="3.12">like</text><text start="404.8" dur="4.399">breathe on it or poke it with your</text><text start="406.72" dur="4.72">finger without completely destroying the</text><text start="409.199" dur="3.521">metal coating so they&amp;#39;ve got that going</text><text start="411.44" dur="4">for them</text><text start="412.72" dur="2.72">which is nice</text><text start="415.599" dur="3.201">now the whole point here is that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="417.199" dur="4.081">taking these</text><text start="418.8" dur="3.839">nasty chemicals and spraying them into</text><text start="421.28" dur="3.44">the air so i will be wearing a</text><text start="422.639" dur="5.041">respirator the whole time that i&amp;#39;m doing</text><text start="424.72" dur="5.28">this this silvering process is actually</text><text start="427.68" dur="4.72">a set of sprays that evenly distribute</text><text start="430" dur="4.88">the precursors across the surface you</text><text start="432.4" dur="5.28">want to coat and then they react on the</text><text start="434.88" dur="5.36">surface deposit elemental metallic</text><text start="437.68" dur="3.519">silver and the excess chemicals wash</text><text start="440.24" dur="2.959">away</text><text start="441.199" dur="4.961">because this is actually a commercial</text><text start="443.199" dur="6.161">kit i can&amp;#39;t say with certainty what&amp;#39;s</text><text

reactions</text><text start="457.52" dur="5.76">the silver ions in silver nitrate are</text><text start="460.24" dur="5.6">converted into diamine silver which can</text><text start="463.28" dur="5.599">be reduced into elemental silver which</text><text start="465.84" dur="5.84">can deposit as a solid metal film on a</text><text start="468.879" dur="5.121">smooth glass or in this case plastic</text><text start="471.68" dur="4.48">surface one thing that weirds me out</text><text start="474" dur="4.56">about the spray silvering technique is</text><text start="476.16" dur="4.479">the necessity of mixing these chemicals</text><text start="478.56" dur="3.919">at the last possible second before</text><text start="480.639" dur="4.801">reaction i don&amp;#39;t know which of

dur="5.44">reacting until mixed but i can say that</text><text start="490.319" dur="4.72">if the silver fails to deposit</text><text start="492.56" dur="4.88">an additional reaction takes place

i didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="505.44" dur="4.879">prepare the surface properly when i</text><text start="508.16" dur="5.04">sprayed the silver containing solution</text><text start="510.319"

dur="2.56">wanted</text><text start="700.399" dur="3.761">it worked</text><text start="701.6" dur="5.12">somehow i had managed to mix a batch of</text><text start="704.16" dur="4.4">resin that reacted with the chemicals</text><text start="706.72" dur="3.52">during the silvering process and</text><text start="708.56" dur="3.839">actually roughened to the point where it</text><text start="710.24" dur="4">wouldn&amp;#39;t be a mirror anymore sometimes</text><text start="712.399" dur="3.68">it was so bad that you could see the</text><text start="714.24" dur="4.8">roughness even before the silvering</text><text start="716.079" dur="5.121">agent went on so something in the hard</text><text start="719.04" dur="4.08">resin was probably reacting with</text><text start="721.2" dur="5.199">something in the wetting agent or even</text><text start="723.12" dur="4.399">the water so what did i do well i tried</text><text start="726.399" dur="2.961">another batch</text><text start="727.519" dur="4.641">and then i tried another batch and then</text><text start="729.36" dur="5.919">i tried another batch unfortunately i</text><text start="732.16" dur="4.799">kept doing something wrong or at least</text><text start="735.279" dur="3.201">different than the first time that i</text><text start="736.959" dur="3.601">tried it when everything worked</text><text start="738.48" dur="4.08">perfectly all i wanted was to be able to</text><text start="740.56" dur="4.24">recreate that based on the fact that</text><text start="742.56" dur="4.32">some of my coded parts seemed like they</text><text start="744.8" dur="4.24">remained kind of tacky and sticky for a</text><text start="746.88" dur="4.8">few days my hypothesis was that i had</text><text start="749.04" dur="5.52">screwed up the ratio of the resin a and</text><text start="751.68" dur="5.52">b and prevented it from curing in the</text><text start="754.56" dur="5.04">way that it wanted to i had also mixed</text><text start="757.2" dur="4.72">all subsequent batches outside in the</text><text start="759.6" dur="4">garage for ventilation after realizing</text><text start="761.92" dur="3.599">with the first batch that the smell was</text><text start="763.6" dur="4.08">pretty terrible for me to be mixing this</text><text start="765.519" dur="4.56">in my office and then just because i</text><text start="767.68" dur="4.399">like adding complexity i was also trying</text><text start="770.079" dur="4.56">to get better optical surfaces and</text><text start="772.079" dur="4.481">wanted a less viscous resin which the</text><text start="774.639" dur="4.161">instructions say can be achieved by</text><text start="776.56" dur="5.36">watering it down with acetone so now i</text><text start="778.8" dur="5.52">had three variables and a deeply wired</text><text start="781.92" dur="4.88">instinct to collect as much data as</text><text start="784.32" dur="4.88">scientifically possible so i ran a grid</text><text start="786.8" dur="4.719">search with every combination of these</text><text start="789.2" dur="4.16">parameters for a total of 12 different</text><text start="791.519" dur="5.12">resin mixtures after seeing these the</text><text start="793.36" dur="5.279">next day i added another variable mixing</text><text start="796.639" dur="4.241">time so i actually now have a four</text><text start="798.639" dur="4.241">dimensional data set and i duplicated a</text><text start="800.88" dur="4.16">few of these original conditions again</text><text start="802.88" dur="3.92">with a much longer mixing time before</text><text start="805.04" dur="3.76">spreading the resin on the parts it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="806.8" dur="4.56">worth pointing out that if you ever see</text><text start="808.8" dur="5.76">a scientist do a big grid search like</text><text start="811.36" dur="4.88">this it generally means that they don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="814.56" dur="3.279">know what&amp;#39;s actually going on and</text><text start="816.24" dur="3.52">they&amp;#39;re just sort of throwing variables</text><text start="817.839" dur="5.12">at the wall and seeing what&amp;#39;ll stick and</text><text start="819.76" dur="4.079">in this case that is exactly what i was</text><text start="822.959" dur="2.56">doing</text><text start="823.839" dur="2.961">okay so some of these are clearly not</text><text start="825.519" dur="4.281">cured because they&amp;#39;re still stuck</text><text start="826.8" dur="3">together</text><text start="830.72" dur="4.32">i&amp;#39;m not a chemist i don&amp;#39;t really know</text><text start="832.72" dur="5.04">how these polymerization reactions work</text><text start="835.04" dur="4.799">so massive grid search land through four</text><text start="837.76" dur="4">dimensional parameter space was really</text><text start="839.839" dur="4.481">the only avenue that i could walk down</text><text start="841.76" dur="4.4">and hope for a useful result after a few</text><text start="844.32" dur="4.24">days waiting for all these samples to</text><text start="846.16" dur="5.039">cure i attempted to silver them all</text><text start="848.56" dur="5.04">along with another previously unsilvered</text><text start="851.199"

most as in</text><text start="859.68" dur="6.64">thankfully not all because a few of them</text><text start="863.519" dur="5.201">did produce mirror finishes turns out</text><text start="866.32" dur="3.92">that curing them inside is better for</text><text start="868.72" dur="4.16">reasons that i really don&amp;#39;t yet</text><text start="870.24" dur="4.959">understand acetone doesn&amp;#39;t seem to do</text><text start="872.88" dur="4.959">much and if you screw up the ratio of</text><text start="875.199" dur="4.961">part a and part b it&amp;#39;s better to air on</text><text start="877.839" dur="4.56">the side of an a-rich mixture if you</text><text start="880.16" dur="4.08">don&amp;#39;t want the surface to react with the</text><text start="882.399" dur="4.56">silvering
