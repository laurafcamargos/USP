time-lapse</text><text start="5.359" dur="6.561">technique but the hdr wasn&amp;#39;t quite deep</text><text start="8.559" dur="6.881">enough to actually see the eclipsed red</text><text start="11.92" dur="5.92">moon and the mount was shaking and the</text><text start="15.44" dur="5.28">clouds rolled in and then i ran out of</text><text start="17.84" dur="4.96">space on the sd card so it went really</text><text start="20.72" dur="4.16">well so i waited for three years i</text><text start="22.8" dur="4.239">bought some new equipment i made a plan</text><text start="24.88" dur="4.399">i spent a week obsessively watching</text><text start="27.039" dur="4.24">cloud maps across the state and then</text><text start="29.279" dur="4.241">when the time came drove out somewhere</text><text start="31.279" dur="5.201">that i hoped it would be dark and cloud</text><text start="33.52" dur="5.52">free set up all my equipment and started</text><text start="36.48" dur="4.399">rolling unfortunately it wasn&amp;#39;t actually</text><text start="39.04" dur="4.24">cloud free but i think that the footage</text><text start="40.879" dur="5.601">that i got is still pretty cool this is</text><text start="43.28" dur="4.959">a time lapse of the spring 2022 lunar</text><text start="46.48" dur="3.84">eclipse and although it has a few</text><text start="48.239" dur="4.721">problems notably some sketchy</text><text start="50.32" dur="4.879">stabilization and an abundance of clouds</text><text start="52.96" dur="4.96">it&amp;#39;s a lot better than my previous</text><text start="55.199" dur="5.36">attempt let me explain the motion of the</text><text start="57.92" dur="4.72">moon the earth shadow and the background</text><text start="60.559" dur="4">field of stars here because it&amp;#39;s more</text><text start="62.64" dur="3.68">counter-intuitive than you might expect</text><text start="64.559" dur="4.321">and i want to talk about what makes this</text><text start="66.32" dur="4.96">two-camera hdr process</text><text start="68.88" dur="4.32">different from the vast majority of</text><text start="71.28" dur="3.95">eclipse time lapses that you&amp;#39;ll probably</text><text start="73.2" dur="11.68">see</text><text start="75.23" dur="11.81">[Music]</text><text start="84.88" dur="5.44">during a total lunar eclipse the moon</text><text start="87.04" dur="5.52">passes behind earth&amp;#39;s shadow relative to</text><text start="90.32" dur="4">the sun so the moon is no longer in</text><text start="92.56" dur="3.68">direct sunlight i don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="94.32" dur="4.4">going to surprise any viewers of the</text><text start="96.24" dur="4.96">channel but this means that the moon is</text><text start="98.72" dur="5.359">then illuminated only by light that</text><text start="101.2" dur="4.559">scatters through earth&amp;#39;s atmosphere so</text><text start="104.079" dur="4.481">basically if you were on the moon</text><text start="105.759" dur="5.201">looking at earth during a lunar eclipse</text><text start="108.56" dur="4.16">you would see like a ring of sunset all</text><text start="110.96" dur="3.68">the way around earth that&amp;#39;s really the</text><text start="112.72" dur="3.759">only light that reaches the moon which</text><text start="114.64" dur="3.6">is why the moon looks red if you look at</text><text start="116.479" dur="4.161">this as an outside observer you can</text><text start="118.24" dur="4.72">imagine that as earth moves around the</text><text start="120.64" dur="4.4">sun its shadow is going to point in</text><text start="122.96" dur="4.799">different directions all the time and</text><text start="125.04" dur="5.12">then the moon orbiting earth faster</text><text start="127.759" dur="4.641">could pass through this shadow which</text><text start="130.16" dur="5.12">would give us a picture like this where</text><text start="132.4" dur="5.76">relative to faraway stars earth&amp;#39;s total</text><text start="135.28" dur="5.2">shadow or umbra would move from west to</text><text start="138.16" dur="5.76">east at about one degree per day because</text><text start="140.48" dur="6.32">it has to go 360 degrees</text><text start="143.92" dur="5.28">about every 365 days and the moon would</text><text start="146.8" dur="4.799">move west to east at about 12 degrees</text><text start="149.2" dur="5.119">per day weirdly enough that&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="151.599" dur="4.561">actually what i filmed aside from tilts</text><text start="154.319" dur="4.321">because orbits are all a little bit</text><text start="156.16" dur="5.92">crooked i actually saw earth&amp;#39;s shadow</text><text start="158.64" dur="5.52">move overall from east to west relative</text><text start="162.08" dur="4.08">to the star field i was pretty confused</text><text start="164.16" dur="4.079">by this when i started analyzing the</text><text start="166.16" dur="4.64">footage but then i realized i was</text><text start="168.239" dur="4.801">filming from a moving vantage point i</text><text start="170.8" dur="4.32">was not the outside observer looking</text><text start="173.04" dur="3.839">down on the solar system from above if</text><text start="175.12" dur="3.759">you are that outside observer then we</text><text start="176.879" dur="4.801">expect a simple model where the umbra is</text><text start="178.879" dur="4.561">going to move from right to left and the</text><text start="181.68" dur="4.08">moon is going to move from right to left</text><text start="183.44" dur="4.159">much faster and the moon&amp;#39;s going to pass</text><text start="185.76" dur="5.28">behind the umbra but</text><text start="187.599" dur="5.92">if you&amp;#39;re on earth&amp;#39;s surface then you</text><text start="191.04" dur="4.96">also are moving and over the course of</text><text start="193.519" dur="4.08">one night you actually shift and you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="196" dur="2.48">looking at the moon from a different</text><text start="197.599" dur="3.36">direction</text><text start="198.48" dur="4.32">this time lapse took like five hours to</text><text start="200.959" dur="3.441">film so in the early evening i was</text><text start="202.8" dur="3.68">basically looking at the moon from this</text><text start="204.4" dur="3.759">angle and then after a few hours you</text><text start="206.48" dur="3.2">know past midnight i was looking at the</text><text start="208.159" dur="4.72">moon from a completely different</text><text start="209.68" dur="6">direction so relative to the background</text><text start="212.879" dur="4.64">stars the moon actually appears to move</text><text start="215.68" dur="3.52">specifically it looks like it&amp;#39;s moving</text><text start="217.519" dur="3.521">from east to west it looks like it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="219.2" dur="3.759">moving backwards turns out that this</text><text start="221.04" dur="4.32">effect is actually much faster than</text><text start="222.959" dur="5.36">earth&amp;#39;s movement around the sun but</text><text start="225.36" dur="5.599">angularly speaking much slower than the</text><text start="228.319" dur="4.64">moon&amp;#39;s orbit around earth which means</text><text start="230.959" dur="4">that the moon still looks like it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="232.959" dur="3.84">going in the correct direction across</text><text start="234.959" dur="5.36">the frame but it looks like it&amp;#39;s going</text><text start="236.799" dur="5.921">too slow and earth&amp;#39;s shadow resolved at</text><text start="240.319" dur="4.081">the distance of the moon not at a</text><text start="242.72" dur="4.4">semi-infinite distance like the rest of</text><text start="244.4" dur="4.479">the stars actually appears to reverse</text><text start="247.12" dur="4.08">direction so with a whole bunch of</text><text start="248.879" dur="5.201">canceling effects here earth&amp;#39;s shadow</text><text start="251.2" dur="5.2">actually appears to move east to west</text><text start="254.08" dur="5.439">relative to the stars while the moon</text><text start="256.4" dur="4.959">itself seems to move west to east it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="259.519" dur="3.68">real mess but it results in a pretty</text><text start="261.359" dur="3.761">cool view but there&amp;#39;s more to this time</text><text start="263.199" dur="4.481">lapse the thing that i was really trying</text><text start="265.12" dur="4.72">to accomplish was not looking at the</text><text start="267.68" dur="3.68">relative motion of earth&amp;#39;s umbra and the</text><text start="269.84" dur="3.68">star field i just thought that was cool</text><text start="271.36" dur="5.279">and i wanted to open with it the goal of</text><text start="273.52" dur="6.239">this time lapse was actually to create a</text><text start="276.639" dur="4.241">more realistic view of an eclipse and it</text><text start="279.759" dur="3.361">required</text><text start="280.88" dur="4">a surprising amount of</text><text start="283.12" dur="3.68">camera foolery</text><text start="284.88" dur="5.28">so i have long been frustrated by seeing</text><text start="286.8" dur="4.48">time lapses of eclipses solar and lunar</text><text start="290.16" dur="4.479">where</text><text start="291.28" dur="6.96">the camera adjusts halfway through so it</text><text start="294.639" dur="5.521">looks like once the moon is fully behind</text><text start="298.24" dur="3.76">the earth&amp;#39;s shadow and it turns red it</text><text start="300.16" dur="3.599">actually gets brighter</text><text start="302" dur="4.72">and that&amp;#39;s not what happens it might</text><text start="303.759" dur="4.081">look that way to a camera or to your eye</text><text start="306.72" dur="3.28">because</text><text start="307.84" dur="4.48">your brain sort of auto corrects for how</text><text start="310" dur="4.16">bright the environment is but in reality</text><text start="312.32" dur="2.8">that is the darkest part of the eclipse</text><text start="314.16" dur="2.56">because</text><text start="315.12" dur="4.799">the moon&amp;#39;s not being lit by sunlight</text><text start="316.72" dur="5.84">it&amp;#39;s being lit by sort of the</text><text start="319.919" dur="5.041">aggregated halo of</text><text start="322.56" dur="4.8">sunset that is all the way around earth</text><text start="324.96" dur="4.799">and uh that&amp;#39;s not very much light that</text><text start="327.36" dur="4.64">is scattered through earth&amp;#39;s atmosphere</text><text start="329.759" dur="4.801">that said tonight i am planning on</text><text start="332" dur="5.28">fixing that so i have here two different</text><text start="334.56" dur="5.28">cameras that are both pointed at the</text><text start="337.28" dur="3.84">moon and both set up to run for about</text><text start="339.84" dur="3.6">five hours so we should get the</text><text start="341.12" dur="4.32">penumbral eclipse and then the actual</text><text start="343.44" dur="5.52">eclipse and then the outgoing penumbral</text><text start="345.44" dur="5.92">eclipse and this camera right here</text><text start="348.96" dur="5.6">is set up to take a bracket of three</text><text start="351.36" dur="5.6">pictures and properly expose sort of the</text><text start="354.56" dur="3.759">regular moon like the normal bright moon</text><text start="356.96" dur="2.959">that you&amp;#39;re used to</text><text start="358.319" dur="4.16">this camera</text><text start="359.919" dur="5.761">is set up to properly record the</text><text start="362.479" dur="4.401">eclipsed moon the red moon and</text><text start="365.68" dur="4">none of these settings are going to</text><text start="366.88" dur="4.48">change so i&amp;#39;m going to combine these i&amp;#39;m</text><text start="369.68" dur="3.44">going to have four images for every</text><text start="371.36" dur="3.44">frame of this time lapse and i&amp;#39;m going</text><text start="373.12" dur="4.32">to combine these in such a way that the</text><text start="374.8" dur="4.959">moon actually gets dimmer the whole time</text><text start="377.44" dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s becoming eclipsed the first time i</text><text start="379.759" dur="4.401">tried this a few years ago i had a</text><text start="381.6" dur="4.8">single camera on a homemade barn door</text><text start="384.16" dur="4.24">tracker and i was taking the widest</text><text start="386.4" dur="3.68">bracket that the camera would allow</text><text start="388.4" dur="3.28">which basically means that every time</text><text start="390.08" dur="3.76">that the shutter was pulled by the</text><text start="391.68" dur="4.48">intervalometer the camera took three</text><text start="393.84" dur="5.919">pictures at three different exposures</text><text start="396.16" dur="5.92">one the dimmest exposure was at one</text><text start="399.759" dur="5.121">thousandth of a second and this was able</text><text start="402.08" dur="4.32">to properly capture the sunlit moon this</text><text start="404.88" dur="3.599">is what you&amp;#39;d use to take a picture of</text><text start="406.4" dur="3.44">like the full moon and then there was an</text><text start="408.479" dur="3.601">intermediate frame and then the</text><text start="409.84" dur="4.88">brightest frame was actually holding the</text><text start="412.08" dur="5.839">shutter open for a full 15th of a second</text><text start="414.72" dur="5.12">not a thousandth of a second and this is</text><text start="417.919" dur="3.441">dramatically more light and you can see</text><text start="419.84" dur="4">that when you&amp;#39;re looking at one of the</text><text start="421.36" dur="5.52">images of the full moon it&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="423.84" dur="5.199">totally bleached out but when you look</text><text start="426.88" dur="4.64">at one of the images of the eclipsed</text><text start="429.039" dur="5.801">moon the eclipsed moon is actually too</text><text start="431.52" dur="6">dark so we need something even more</text><text start="434.84" dur="5">separated and for that i needed a second</text><text start="437.52" dur="4.959">camera fast forward a few years and i</text><text start="439.84" dur="5.52">now have a second camera and i bought a</text><text start="442.479" dur="6">second second well a second lens which</text><text start="445.36" dur="4.8">was also a second hand lens but i got</text><text start="448.479" dur="4">another lens that was exactly the same</text><text start="450.16" dur="3.599">so that i could have two cameras with</text><text start="452.479" dur="3.44">although they&amp;#39;re not the same sensor</text><text start="453.759" dur="4.88">they have the same size sensor so that i</text><text start="455.919" dur="5.12">could mount them together pointed at the</text><text start="458.639" dur="4.481">moon and have them spin on a mount that</text><text start="461.039" dur="4.88">was better than my barn door tracker and</text><text start="463.12" dur="4.88">try to get two frames that had</text><text start="465.919" dur="3.761">completely different exposures a minute</text><text start="468" dur="4.16">ago i said that i was actually taking</text><text start="469.68" dur="4.48">four frames a three frame bracket on one</text><text start="472.16" dur="4.159">camera and a single frame on the second</text><text start="474.16" dur="3.759">camera but for the final composition i</text><text start="476.319" dur="4.801">actually only ended up using two of</text><text start="477.919" dur="5.361">those frames the 1000th of a second same</text><text start="481.12" dur="5.44">as the first time but for the bright</text><text start="483.28" dur="6">image i&amp;#39;m using a 2 second exposure so</text><text start="486.56" dur="5.84">this is a 2 000</text><text start="489.28" dur="4.88">times difference in light between these</text><text start="492.4" dur="3.919">two pictures so they&amp;#39;re going to be</text><text start="494.16" dur="5.28">really dramatically different if i</text><text start="496.319" dur="4">represented this completely linearly</text><text start="499.44" dur="3.28">then</text><text start="500.319" dur="4.88">i mean you you wouldn&amp;#39;t see the eclipsed</text><text start="502.72" dur="4.319">moon like the brightest pixel on the</text><text start="505.199" dur="4.641">eclipsed moon is going to be something</text><text start="507.039" dur="5.041">like a thousand times dimmer than the</text><text start="509.84" dur="4.16">brightest pixel on the regular moon so</text><text start="512.08" dur="3.68">if you&amp;#39;re looking at the regular moon on</text><text start="514" dur="3.919">your phone screen or your computer</text><text start="515.76" dur="6.32">screen that resolves colors between 0</text><text start="517.919" dur="6.881">and 255 then literally every pixel of</text><text start="522.08" dur="5.12">the eclipsed moon is going to be below</text><text start="524.8" dur="5.76">one and you&amp;#39;re just gonna get a field of</text><text start="527.2" dur="7.04">black on that screen so that&amp;#39;s not very</text><text start="530.56" dur="6">interesting it&amp;#39;s also not what your eye</text><text start="534.24" dur="4.24">perceives when you look at the night sky</text><text start="536.56" dur="4.16">your eye does not see things the same</text><text start="538.48" dur="5.2">way that a camera does your eye and</text><text start="540.72" dur="5.44">brain together do a fantastic job of</text><text start="543.68" dur="5.279">selectively making parts of your vision</text><text start="546.16" dur="5.6">brighter and darker to maximize contrast</text><text start="548.959" dur="5.361">across the field now it&amp;#39;s very possible</text><text start="551.76" dur="4.48">to see stars right next to a really</text><text start="554.32" dur="4.24">bright moon with your eye but it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="556.24" dur="5.12">possible by taking a single exposure in</text><text start="558.56" dur="5.2">a camera likewise halfway into a lunar</text><text start="561.36" dur="4.32">eclipse your eye can totally see that</text><text start="563.76" dur="3.759">half of the moon is starting to look red</text><text start="565.68" dur="3.36">even when it hasn&amp;#39;t been fully covered</text><text start="567.519" dur="3.681">up yet and</text><text start="569.04" dur="4.08">that&amp;#39;s because your eye is perceiving</text><text start="571.2" dur="4.24">the faintest of contrast that is</text><text start="573.12" dur="4.48">actually below the dynamic range</text><text start="575.44" dur="4">threshold of the camera in this image</text><text start="577.6" dur="3.84">that i&amp;#39;ve spliced together you can see</text><text start="579.44" dur="3.92">that half of the moon is white half the</text><text start="581.44" dur="5.04">moon is red and then there&amp;#39;s this sort</text><text start="583.36" dur="5.039">of muted gray region in the middle that</text><text start="586.48" dur="3.52">your eye just sort of glosses over and</text><text start="588.399" dur="3.521">it ends up showing you the two high</text><text start="590" dur="3.76">contrast regions so when i wanted to</text><text start="591.92" dur="4">shoot a time lapse where you could see</text><text start="593.76" dur="3.04">both halves of the moon the whole time</text><text start="595.92" dur="3.76">and</text><text start="596.8" dur="5.279">the moon got progressively darker as it</text><text start="599.68" dur="5.52">got more eclipsed i artificially</text><text start="602.079" dur="5.76">amplified the dark footage the red moon</text><text start="605.2" dur="5.36">footage just by taking longer exposure</text><text start="607.839" dur="5.521">and then in processing was very careful</text><text start="610.56" dur="5.68">that i never allowed that footage to get</text><text start="613.36" dur="5.2">brighter than the light moon footage</text><text start="616.24" dur="5.44">with the fully sunlit moon the key is</text><text start="618.56" dur="5.279">that both cameras were not automatically</text><text start="621.68" dur="4.56">adjusting their exposures both cameras</text><text start="623.839" dur="4.56">were fixed the entire time they were</text><text start="626.24" dur="4.159">processed individually with processing</text><text start="628.399" dur="4.56">that stays the same for every single</text><text start="630.399" dur="5.281">frame of the time lapse and then in the</text><text start="632.959"

all that it&amp;#39;s still</text><text start="884.639" dur="3.601">very far from perfect the correct way to</text><text start="886.88" dur="2.8">do this would be to write a piece of</text><text

dur="4.801">have pictures of the moon in them and</text><text start="983.839" dur="5.601">not just the clouds it uses all of these</text><text start="986.56" dur="5.279">adjacent frame offsets to run a fit for</text><text start="989.44" dur="4.639">x and y and then it moves the frame</text><text start="991.839" dur="5.041">saves it stuffing my hard drive with</text><text start="994.079"
