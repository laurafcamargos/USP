determining</text><text start="41.6" dur="3.52">how much the government will spend by</text><text start="43.2" dur="3.6">writing a budget so while the president</text><text start="45.12" dur="3.439">does get to submit budgets to congress</text><text start="46.8" dur="3.759">and asks for changes in the tax level</text><text start="48.559" dur="3.68">these are just requests that

start="81.2" dur="4.16">almost always congress puts more stuff</text><text start="83.28" dur="3.68">in the budget than they cover with taxes</text><text start="85.36" dur="4">which means that the president must</text><text start="86.96" dur="4">borrow money to cover the difference in</text><text start="89.36" dur="3.439">most countries the story ends here</text><text start="90.96" dur="3.44">because if their legislatures approve</text><text start="92.799" dur="3.761">more spending than they have income</text><text start="94.4" dur="4.8">they&amp;#39;ve also implicitly approved the</text><text start="96.56" dur="4.96">necessary borrowing but not in america</text><text start="99.2" dur="4.16">here congress also limits the total</text><text start="101.52" dur="3.84">amount of

dur="3.121">reckless spending has brought us so</text><text start="117.759" dur="4">close to the debt limit that they</text><text start="119.28" dur="3.839">reasonable prudent congress have set and</text><text start="121.759" dur="2.881">while it&amp;#39;s technically correct that the</text><text start="123.119" dur="3.441">president has borrowed this money</text><text start="124.64" dur="3.759">congress has forced him to do it by</text><text start="126.56" dur="4.24">approving a budget that the president is</text><text start="128.399" dur="4.641">legally obligated to spend without also</text><text start="130.8" dur="4.56">approving the necessary taxes to cover</text><text start="133.04" dur="3.839">that spending so the debt limit fight is</text><text start="135.36" dur="3.36">essentially the government version of</text><text start="136.879" dur="4.08">the playground favorite stop hitting</text><text start="138.72" dur="4.4">yourself except with added terror for</text><text start="140.959" dur="4.481">everyone watching for it&amp;#39;s important to</text><text start="143.12" dur="4.32">note the debt limit is not about future</text><text start="145.44" dur="3.76">spending it&amp;#39;s not a credit card on which</text><text start="147.44" dur="3.92">the limit will be raised so a crazy</text><text start="149.2" dur="4.399">government party can be thrown the debt</text><text start="151.36" dur="4.159">limit is about paying bills already</text><text start="153.599" dur="3.681">incurred for example the government</text><text start="155.519" dur="3.761">hires a company to repave a federal</text><text start="157.28" dur="3.84">highway but if the us is at the debt</text><text start="159.28" dur="3.28">limit when the company asks to be

dur="4.321">the u.s and since large parts of the</text><text start="167.2" dur="4">global economy depend on the dollar</text><text start="169.28" dur="4.64">being trustworthy messing with that</text><text start="171.2" dur="4.56">trust is a big deal but there is a way</text><text start="173.92" dur="3.599">out congress can raise the debt limit</text><text start="175.76" dur="4.24">and because of the aforementioned terror</text><text start="177.519" dur="4.241">they always have so if not raising the</text><text start="180" dur="3.519">debt ceiling is potentially disastrous</text><text start="181.76" dur="4.479">and the solution is simple and always</text><text start="183.519" dur="6.241">taken in the end why does this debate</text><text start="186.239" dur="5.681">last months because politics the debt</text><text start="189.76" dur="3.92">limit isn&amp;#39;t in the constitution congress</text><text start="191.92" dur="4">created it themselves and from their</text><text start="193.68" dur="4.479">point of view the debt limit is awesome</text><text start="195.92" dur="4">because one it creates a problem that</text><text start="198.159" dur="3.281">two congress can technically blame on</text><text start="199.92" dur="3.84">the president who three needs the</text><text start="201.44" dur="3.76">solution that only they can
