dur="3.52">about two basic forces</text><text start="13.84" dur="3.439">the gravitational force and the</text><text start="15.44" dur="3.599">electromagnetic force</text><text start="17.279" dur="4.801">but in the course of the 20th century</text><text start="19.039" dur="5.761">when they started to study</text><text start="22.08" dur="4.48">atoms and their interiors it became</text><text start="24.8" dur="4.16">clear that those forces</text><text start="26.56" dur="3.92">were not the whole story and in</text><text start="28.96" dur="3.68">particular one needed</text><text start="30.48" dur="3.599">a very powerful force to hold atomic</text><text start="32.64" dur="3.84">nuclei together because</text><text start="34.079" dur="4.401">gravity is much too weak and the</text><text start="36.48" dur="6.96">electromagnetic forces in fact want to</text><text start="38.48" dur="8">want to explode nuclei they&amp;#39;re repulsive</text><text start="43.44" dur="4.799">so it came to the top of the agenda to</text><text start="46.48" dur="5.599">determine what this force is</text><text start="48.239" dur="7.281">we were fortunate enough to glom onto</text><text start="52.079" dur="7.681">what turned out to be the key</text><text start="55.52" dur="7.28">that opened this door uh which is that</text><text start="59.76" dur="4.88">people had observed that the the</text><text start="62.8" dur="4.16">strong force had a very unusual</text><text start="64.64" dur="5.04">character of becoming</text><text start="66.96" dur="3.92">weaker at high energies or at short</text><text start="69.68" dur="4.32">distances</text><text start="70.88" dur="5.12">this idea is very unusual</text><text start="74" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s not the way gravitational forces</text><text start="76" dur="3.92">work they get stronger it&amp;#39;s not the way</text><text start="78.08" dur="5.039">electromagnetic forces work they get</text><text start="79.92" dur="5.519">stronger at shorter distances</text><text start="83.119" dur="4.081">and it was very difficult to reconcile</text><text start="85.439" dur="2.641">that behavior with the general</text><text start="87.2" dur="4.32">principles</text><text start="88.08" dur="6.48">that we thought of as sacred of</text><text start="91.52" dur="5.84">quantum mechanics and and relativity so</text><text start="94.56" dur="4.559">we struggled to find a theoretical</text><text start="97.36" dur="4">framework a set of equations that</text><text start="99.119" dur="4.401">reconciled all those things those two</text><text start="101.36" dur="3.439">those basic principles and this funny</text><text start="103.52" dur="3.2">behavior</text><text start="104.799" dur="4.161">and we found that there was basically</text><text start="106.72" dur="3.679">just one way to do it and so we proposed</text><text start="108.96" dur="2.32">that that was the theory of the strong</text><text start="110.399" dur="2.441">interaction</text><text start="111.28" dur="4.08">we were right they got the right</text><text start="112.84" dur="3.8">equations and they&amp;#39;ve been very fruitful</text><text start="115.36" dur="3.359">they&amp;#39;ve enabled us to</text><text start="116.64" dur="3.2">understand the early universe better to</text><text start="118.719" dur="3.201">understand</text><text start="119.84" dur="3.44">what happens at high energy accelerators</text><text start="121.92" dur="4.64">are much better</text><text start="123.28" dur="7.119">and to have some success in constructing</text><text start="126.56" dur="3.839">a way of unifying all the forces</text><text start="137.16" dur="4.04">[Music]</text><text start="139.2" dur="4.72">some outstanding examples of beauty and</text><text start="141.2" dur="5.44">physics that are close to my heart</text><text start="143.92" dur="3.44">are the equations that govern the strong</text><text start="146.64" dur="3.599">interaction</text><text start="147.36" dur="3.28">so-called quantum chromodynamics which</text><text start="150.239" dur="2.561">is</text><text start="150.64" dur="3.679">almost ideally mathematically beautiful</text><text start="152.8" dur="3.519">it&amp;#39;s an embodiment of</text><text start="154.319" dur="3.361">symmetry the whole structure of the</text><text start="156.319" dur="4.961">theory is dictated</text><text start="157.68" dur="7.279">by very simple mathematical principles</text><text start="161.28" dur="6.239">another is axions where we&amp;#39;re led</text><text start="164.959" dur="4">by small violations of symmetry that</text><text start="167.519" dur="3.601">have been observed to</text><text start="168.959" dur="3.041">a certain way of trying to explain why</text><text start="171.12" dur="3.119">they&amp;#39;re small</text><text start="172" dur="4.64">that leads to very special equations</text><text start="174.239" dur="5.441">that have remarkable properties</text><text start="176.64" dur="4.4">and part of the beauty is the equations</text><text start="179.68" dur="3.76">part of the beauty is that</text><text start="181.04" dur="3.44">they may explain so much about how the</text><text start="183.44" dur="3.84">world works</text><text start="184.48" dur="3.759">so these are remarkable instances where</text><text start="187.28" dur="4">mathematical</text><text start="188.239" dur="6.161">abstract beauty also turns out to be</text><text start="191.28" dur="6.72">powerfully applied to describe

relationships</text><text start="221.76" dur="3.839">that we can have with the physical world</text><text start="224.4" dur="4.32">based on</text><text start="225.599" dur="5.761">the best hard-won knowledge</text><text start="228.72" dur="4.32">that that we&amp;#39;ve accumulated i would say</text><text start="231.36" dur="2.56">two of the highlights for me that i sort</text><text start="233.04" dur="4.88">of discovered</text><text start="233.92" dur="6.48">in writing the book are the concept that</text><text start="237.92" dur="5.039">to come into proper relationship

dur="2.32">world</text><text start="246.64" dur="3.2">have to make models for even the most</text><text start="248.4" dur="4.72">basic things of</text><text start="249.84" dur="5.679">how do you

start="256.959" dur="3.041">objects</text><text start="258.239" dur="3.68">uh that has to be learned and it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="260" dur="3.28">difficult process when you study the</text><text start="261.919" dur="3.041">world scientifically</text><text start="263.28" dur="3.44">you learn that the world is actually</text><text start="264.96" dur="4.959">quite different than the one</text><text start="266.72" dur="6.479">you constructed as a child and so</text><text start="269.919" dur="5.601">you have to unlearn things and i call</text><text start="273.199" dur="4.241">that a process of being born again</text><text start="275.52" dur="3.84">the question that was central to my</text><text start="277.44" dur="4.88">previous book a beautiful question was</text><text start="279.36" dur="4.96">does the world embody beautiful ideas i</text><text start="282.32" dur="3.84">considered that very seriously from</text><text start="284.32" dur="5.04">different points of view and came to</text><text start="286.16" dur="6.8">what i think is a convincing answer yes</text><text start="289.36" dur="6.32">and maybe the most</text><text start="292.96" dur="4">convincing evidence of that is that</text><text start="295.68" dur="4.64">equations</text><text start="296.96" dur="7.04">that we propose based on idea</text><text start="300.32" dur="4.319">aesthetic ideas of what would be the</text><text start="304" dur="4.16">most</text><text start="304.639" dur="4.801">balanced economical symmetrical possible</text><text

dur="5.36">so it turns out that the operating</text><text start="317.199" dur="4.081">system that governs the world</text><text start="319.36" dur="3.44">is something we can also
