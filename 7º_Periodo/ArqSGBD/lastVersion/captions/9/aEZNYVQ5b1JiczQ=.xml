dur="4.32">throughout human history that led us to</text><text start="16.32" dur="5">First discover how far away objects in</text><text start="18.64" dur="4.6">the cosmos really are appreciating how</text><text start="21.32" dur="4.4">we know these distances is to me more</text><text start="23.24" dur="4.439">amazing than the distances themselves</text><text start="25.72" dur="3.84">this is

be</text><text start="31.599" dur="3.521">relatively self-contained but for</text><text start="33.399" dur="3.921">context we left off with Kepler&amp;#39;s</text><text start="35.12" dur="3.88">ingenious method for deducing the shapes</text><text start="37.32" dur="3.52">of all of the orbits of the planets</text><text start="39" dur="3.48">around the Sun so people knew what the</text><text start="40.84" dur="4.12">solar system looked like but they still</text><text start="42.48" dur="4.64">didn&amp;#39;t have an exact sense of scale and</text><text start="44.96" dur="3.919">this left astronomers hungry to measure</text><text start="47.12" dur="4.04">any distance that they could in this</text><text start="48.879" dur="4.601">system like maybe how far away a given</text><text start="51.16" dur="4.199">planet is from Earth at a given moment</text><text start="53.48" dur="4.079">since that would be enough to lock</text><text start="55.359" dur="4">everything else into place now I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="57.559" dur="3.8">admit while I had vaguely learned about</text><text start="59.359" dur="3.761">how this was done before I definitely</text><text start="61.359" dur="2.641">had not appreciated the cleverness of</text><text start="63.12" dur="3.44">the</text><text start="64" dur="4.32">details you could measure distances to</text><text start="66.56" dur="2.96">the planets like Venus take two</text><text start="68.32" dur="3">measurements on different sides of the</text><text start="69.52" dur="3.52">Earth around the time of Captain Cook</text><text start="71.32" dur="3.72">when when they were traveling to</text><text start="73.04" dur="3.119">discover Australia and so forth part of</text><text start="75.04" dur="2.6">the reason for this was the scientific</text><text start="76.159" dur="3.441">Mission I mean they wanted to know the</text><text start="77.64" dur="3.119">distance to Venus and Mars and so forth</text><text start="79.6" dur="2.64">they wanted people to take precise</text><text start="80.759" dur="2.841">measurements they W in Greenwich in the</text><text start="82.24" dur="3.559">UK and one somewhere in southern</text><text start="83.6" dur="4.8">hemisphere at exactly the same time of</text><text start="85.799" dur="4.121">the same object the key idea here is</text><text start="88.4" dur="3.16">that as you sail down to the Sou</text><text start="89.92" dur="3.68">Southern Hemisphere and You observe a</text><text start="91.56" dur="3.68">given object up in the sky its position</text><text start="93.6" dur="3.64">in the sky say relative to the</text><text start="95.24" dur="4.32">background constellations will appear to</text><text start="97.24" dur="4.64">shift up as the angle of your line of</text><text start="99.56" dur="4.239">sight slowly changes with your position</text><text start="101.88" dur="3.32">we call this Parallax it is the same</text><text start="103.799" dur="2.801">Parallax that we use with binocular</text><text start="105.2" dur="2.84">vision our eyes are a certain distance</text><text start="106.6" dur="2.839">apart and so we can determine depth or</text><text start="108.04" dur="3.28">any distance that&amp;#39;s not too much larger</text><text start="109.439" dur="2.881">than the distance between our eyes say</text><text start="111.32" dur="3.24">that now we figured out how to make two</text><text start="112.32" dur="3.399">eyeballs on different sides of the earth</text><text start="114.56" dur="3.44">now if you want to turn this into a</text><text start="115.719" dur="4.4">measurement you first need to understand</text><text start="118" dur="4.2">this line right here connecting the two</text><text start="120.119" dur="4.161">different observation points both its</text><text start="122.2" dur="3.559">distance and its direction because</text><text start="124.28" dur="2.64">people knew the size of the Earth and</text><text start="125.759" dur="3.241">they could tell where they were on the</text><text start="126.92" dur="3.759">earth that would be taken care of then</text><text start="129" dur="3.68">the hard part is for the first Observer</text><text start="130.679" dur="4.001">to take a precise enough measurement of</text><text start="132.68" dur="4.16">the viewing angle to this object they</text><text start="134.68" dur="4.32">need to deduce this angle here and for</text><text start="136.84" dur="3.88">the second Observer to do likewise if</text><text start="139" dur="3.64">you can do that you have a triangle</text><text start="140.72" dur="3.36">where you know all three of the angles</text><text start="142.64" dur="3.16">and you also know one of the side</text><text start="144.08" dur="3.6">lengths this means with just a little</text><text start="145.8" dur="3.719">bit of trigonometry you can figure out</text><text start="147.68" dur="3.68">any other side length which for example</text><text start="149.519" dur="3.921">tells you how far away this object is</text><text start="151.36" dur="3.599">from one of The Observers now the way</text><text start="153.44" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;m drawing it here it makes it look</text><text start="154.959" dur="3.36">almost easy but for the real world</text><text start="156.8" dur="3.64">measurement you have to keep in mind</text><text start="158.319" dur="3.521">just how far away everything is if we</text><text start="160.44" dur="3.159">zoom out so that they&amp;#39;re both looking at</text><text start="161.84" dur="3.44">something as far away as the Moon it</text><text start="163.599" dur="3.601">would look something like this but the</text><text start="165.28" dur="4">moon cosmologically speaking is really</text><text start="167.2" dur="4.759">quite close so even if both of them are</text><text start="169.28" dur="5.08">looking at the nearest planet Venus when</text><text start="171.959" dur="5.841">it is at its absolute closest to Earth</text><text start="174.36" dur="6.12">it&amp;#39;s around 39 million km away which is</text><text start="177.8" dur="5.32">over 6,000 times the radius of of the</text><text start="180.48" dur="4.96">earth so zooming back in to those two</text><text start="183.12" dur="3.88">observers even if they were as far away</text><text start="185.44" dur="3.04">as you could get them one at the top of</text><text start="187" dur="3.44">the earth and another at the bottom of</text><text start="188.48" dur="4.479">the earth these two lines of sight would</text><text start="190.44" dur="4.12">be almost parallel if you work out the</text><text start="192.959" dur="3.521">little bit of trigonometry if they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="194.56" dur="4.28">both looking at Venus at its absolute</text><text start="196.48" dur="4.8">closest point the difference in angle</text><text start="198.84" dur="6.759">between these two lines is about one arc</text><text start="201.28" dur="6.08">minute which is 160th of a degree so if</text><text start="205.599" dur="4">this is going to work your measurements</text><text start="207.36" dur="4.12">have to be extremely precise and you</text><text start="209.599" dur="3.64">have to be absolutely sure that both</text><text start="211.48" dur="4.08">observers are really looking at the same</text><text start="213.239" dur="3.761">thing at the same moment now at the time</text><text start="215.56" dur="3.039">clocks were not good enough that they</text><text start="217" dur="3.2">could actually just say at this specific</text><text start="218.599" dur="3.961">time make this measurement also you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="220.2" dur="3.88">not guaranteed that um you can find the</text><text start="222.56" dur="3.039">planet and so forth but um there these</text><text start="224.08" dur="4.159">transits this this called the transit of</text><text start="225.599" dur="4.681">Venus sometimes Venus travels um along</text><text start="228.239" dur="5.36">the the Sun and so you can just time</text><text start="230.28" dur="5.2">exactly when Venus hits um the edge of</text><text start="233.599" dur="4.081">the sun this is the part I had not</text><text start="235.48" dur="4.52">appreciated in particular how sensitive</text><text start="237.68" dur="3.399">everything really is so up in the north</text><text start="240" dur="2.76">hemisphere if you&amp;#39;re watching the</text><text start="241.079" dur="4.041">transit of Venus maybe it looks</text><text start="242.76" dur="4">something like this and far away at some</text><text start="245.12" dur="3.6">point down in the southern hemisphere</text><text start="246.76" dur="3.64">due to Parallax Venus would appear</text><text start="248.72" dur="4.879">higher up and you essentially want to</text><text start="250.4" dur="5.16">know exactly how much higher up now this</text><text start="253.599" dur="4.32">animation is greatly exaggerating the</text><text start="255.56" dur="4.88">difference in reality the two would look</text><text start="257.919" dur="4.601">much much more similar more like this</text><text start="260.44" dur="3.52">and remember there was no photography so</text><text start="262.52" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s not like they could take pictures</text><text start="263.96" dur="4.2">and closely compare them when you look</text><text start="266.24" dur="4.6">at the Sun up in the sky it spends</text><text start="268.16" dur="3.68">around 32 Ark minutes a viewing angle</text><text start="270.84" dur="3.28">and this is something they would have</text><text start="271.84" dur="4.28">been able to measure the deviation in</text><text start="274.12" dur="4.2">viewing angle to Venus for these two</text><text start="276.12" dur="4.76">observations would be a fraction of an</text><text start="278.32" dur="4.64">arc minute so to measure exactly what</text><text start="280.88" dur="3.72">that fraction was each Observer would</text><text start="282.96" dur="3.32">not try to directly describe where it</text><text start="284.6" dur="3.84">was instead they would measure the</text><text start="286.28" dur="3.56">duration of the transit how long it</text><text start="288.44" dur="3.24">takes from the moment that Venus&amp;#39;s</text><text start="289.84" dur="4.4">silhouette first appears on the disc to</text><text start="291.68" dur="4.32">the moment that it leaves critically</text><text start="294.24" dur="3.44">they also would have known how fast</text><text start="296" dur="3.72">Venus and the sun are moving through the</text><text start="297.68" dur="3.4">sky at this time and this would let them</text><text start="299.72" dur="3.919">calculate how long it should take</text><text start="301.08" dur="5.24">Venus&amp;#39;s apparent position to Traverse</text><text start="303.639" dur="4.721">the distance of say one Sun diameter and</text><text start="306.32" dur="3.48">it turns out to be around 7 hours I</text><text start="308.36" dur="3.24">won&amp;#39;t dwell too much on the details for</text><text start="309.8" dur="3.72">how to calculate this but at a high</text><text start="311.6" dur="4.56">level if you think about Earth and Venus</text><text start="313.52" dur="4.36">both orbiting the Sun the angle of this</text><text start="316.16" dur="3.36">line of sight right here from Earth</text><text start="317.88" dur="3.48">through Venus is something they would</text><text start="319.52" dur="3.679">have understood well since thanks to</text><text start="321.36" dur="3.76">Kepler they knew the relative shapes of</text><text start="323.199" dur="3.881">the orbit and how long it takes each</text><text start="325.12" dur="3.72">planet to go around the Sun so in</text><text start="327.08" dur="3.88">principle they could calculate how long</text><text start="328.84" dur="4.52">it should take for this line to scan</text><text start="330.96" dur="5.16">over those 32 arc minutes in the sky</text><text start="333.36" dur="4.52">that the sun occupied the point is that</text><text start="336.12" dur="3.24">by measuring the durations of the</text><text start="337.88" dur="3.52">transit from these two different</text><text start="339.36" dur="4.839">locations that could tell you the</text><text start="341.4" dur="5.4">lengths of these two lines drawn across</text><text start="344.199" dur="4.761">the sun&amp;#39;s disc these are very similar</text><text start="346.8" dur="3.8">but measurably different and with a</text><text start="348.96" dur="3.64">little bit of circle geometry the</text><text start="350.6" dur="4.28">lengths of those lines will tell you how</text><text start="352.6" dur="4.039">far apart they are that fraction of an</text><text start="354.88" dur="4.28">arc minute separating the two</text><text start="356.639" dur="4">observations and then this in turn from</text><text start="359.16" dur="4.12">everything that we we discussed before</text><text start="360.639" dur="4.68">lets you deduce how far away Venus is in</text><text start="363.28" dur="5.56">terms of the distance between those</text><text start="365.319" dur="5.361">observers that is just so clever to me</text><text start="368.84" dur="3.6">it was Edmund hiy who originally came up</text><text start="370.68" dur="3.68">with this idea but sadly he didn&amp;#39;t live</text><text start="372.44" dur="3.759">long enough to see it come to fruition</text><text start="374.36" dur="4.399">before moving on I simply have to tell</text><text start="376.199" dur="4.601">you the story of Gom Le janil he was</text><text start="378.759" dur="3.16">another Explorer also tasked with making</text><text start="380.8" dur="3.08">one of these measurements for the</text><text start="381.919" dur="4.68">transit of Venus specifically he was</text><text start="383.88" dur="5.24">going for the one in 1761 but he was</text><text start="386.599" dur="4.16">delayed by the 7 years war and still at</text><text start="389.12" dur="3.359">Sea when the Transit happened so he was</text><text start="390.759" dur="3.401">unable to make the measurement now the</text><text start="392.479" dur="3.641">next transit of Venus was going to be 8</text><text start="394.16" dur="4.84">years later but after that it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="396.12" dur="4.72">be for another 105 years so he decided</text><text start="399" dur="3.68">to extend his journey do a bunch of</text><text start="400.84" dur="4.56">other Explorer things and catch the next</text><text start="402.68" dur="5.239">one and by 1769 he was all set up in the</text><text start="405.4" dur="4.4">Philippines ready to go but on that day</text><text start="407.919" dur="3.72">it was cloudy so he couldn&amp;#39;t see</text><text start="409.8" dur="3.2">anything once he finally got back to</text><text start="411.639" dur="3.481">France he found that he had been</text><text start="413" dur="3.56">declared dead his wife had remarried and</text><text start="415.12" dur="3.919">his relatives had all plundered his</text><text start="416.56" dur="4.6">estate now remember the reason people</text><text start="419.039" dur="4.241">cared so much was that having this one</text><text start="421.16" dur="4.2">measurement was enough to lock in place</text><text start="423.28" dur="3.12">the scale of the whole solar system so</text><text start="425.36" dur="2.92">once they had it they would</text><text start="426.4" dur="3.84">automatically know every other distance</text><text start="428.28" dur="3.68">involved this was important actually</text><text start="430.24" dur="2.959">because you need to do this in order to</text><text start="431.96" dur="2.639">work out the distance to the Sun the</text><text start="433.199" dur="3.44">distance of the Sun is is the most</text><text start="434.599" dur="4.121">important rung of the ladder it&amp;#39;s called</text><text start="436.639" dur="3.521">the astronomical unit almost everything</text><text start="438.72" dur="3.599">beyond the solar system is measured in</text><text start="440.16" dur="3.52">terms of the astronomical unit and so</text><text start="442.319" dur="3.801">they really needed really accurate</text><text start="443.68" dur="4.12">estimates given what we just saw you</text><text start="446.12" dur="3.4">might be able to guess how you can use</text><text start="447.8" dur="3.88">this astronomical unit to measure the</text><text start="449.52" dur="3.64">distance to near my stars but before we</text><text start="451.68" dur="3.12">get to that there&amp;#39;s actually one more</text><text start="453.16" dur="3.479">clever deduction that you can make once</text><text start="454.8" dur="3.88">you know this distance a little closer</text><text start="456.639" dur="5.12">to home and Incredibly important for</text><text start="458.68" dur="5.44">physics Roma was measuring Jupiter and</text><text start="461.759" dur="4.201">Jupiter has a small Moon called iio I</text><text start="464.12" dur="3.4">orbits Jupiter really really fast</text><text start="465.96" dur="3.959">because it&amp;#39;s really close to Jupiter our</text><text start="467.52" dur="5.72">moon takes 28 days to go around the</text><text start="469.919" dur="5.12">earth IO takes 42 hours this Whi it yeah</text><text start="473.24" dur="3.76">it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s extremely fast if you if you</text><text start="475.039" dur="3.56">observe Jupiter on a telescope you you</text><text start="477" dur="4.36">see I which is just his white dot go go</text><text start="478.599" dur="5.56">in be behind jup Shadow and out in out</text><text start="481.36" dur="4.799">in out RoR was marking down one precise</text><text start="484.159" dur="4.201">moment for each one of these Cycles you</text><text start="486.159" dur="3.88">see IO goes dark when it falls into</text><text start="488.36" dur="4.119">Jupiter&amp;#39;s Shadow which it does every</text><text start="490.039" dur="4.921">cycle cuz Jupiter is just so big as it</text><text start="492.479" dur="4.321">emerges it becomes bright again watching</text><text start="494.96" dur="4.079">it through a telescope night after night</text><text start="496.8" dur="4.28">you can mark the exact time that it pops</text><text start="499.039" dur="3.401">back into view and if you go out with</text><text start="501.08" dur="2.72">the telescope and you do this a whole</text><text start="502.44" dur="3.759">bunch what you&amp;#39;ll notice is that these</text><text start="503.8" dur="3.76">happen in 42-hour increments like</text><text start="506.199" dur="3.801">clockwork except that it wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="507.56" dur="4.16">Clockwork so Roma was observing</text><text start="510" dur="4.2">I go back and forth back and forth for</text><text start="511.72" dur="4.239">months and he observed that in different</text><text start="514.2" dur="4.36">times of of the year I was ahead of</text><text start="515.959" dur="4.921">schedule I was behind schedule so</text><text start="518.56" dur="4.52">continual picture earth goes on the sun</text><text start="520.88" dur="5.16">Jupiter also goes on the</text><text start="523.08" dur="8.56">sun yeah so when you Imaging the orbit</text><text start="526.04" dur="7.2">of I um it was 20 minutes ahead of 20</text><text start="531.64" dur="3.8">minutes earlier when the Earth was on</text><text start="533.24" dur="3.32">the same side as as Jupiter then when</text><text start="535.44" dur="4">the Earth was on the opposite side of</text><text start="536.56" dur="4.76">Jupiter it took 20 minutes longer was</text><text start="539.44" dur="3.92">there was a delay in the orbit so he</text><text start="541.32" dur="4.36">measured this after some very precise</text><text start="543.36" dur="4.64">calculations and Hans realized that the</text><text start="545.68" dur="4.2">reason for this is because light was</text><text start="548" dur="4.68">taking 20</text><text start="549.88" dur="4.84">minutes to Traverse its extra distance</text><text start="552.68" dur="4.599">so two astronomical</text><text start="554.72"

have a</text><text start="1135.32" dur="4.92">period of intensity like every 20 days</text><text start="1137.88" dur="3.84">every 10 days they oscillate and it</text><text start="1140.24" dur="2.88">turns out that the bigger the seped the</text><text start="1141.72" dur="3.28">brighter it is the longer the period</text><text start="1143.12" dur="5.24">Henri SW Lev who was a 20th

dur="4.681">plotted the</text><text start="1152.799" dur="5.081">period against the</text><text start="1155.84" dur="4.6">intensity and she found basically a</text><text start="1157.88" dur="5.56">linear law that the brighter the SEI the</text><text start="1160.44" dur="5.76">longer it talk that like the H for gave</text><text start="1163.44" dur="4.56">a standard candle that um that if if a</text><text start="1166.2" dur="3.04">Galaxy happened to have a seed in it you</text><text start="1168" dur="3.64">could just observe it</text><text start="1169.24" dur="4.24">work out this period that give you this</text><text start="1171.64" dur="3.64">intensity that know so now you know how</text><text start="1173.48" dur="3.24">bright it should be and you know how</text><text start="1175.28" dur="3.36">bright it looks you can measure this</text><text start="1176.72" dur="5.079">distance that gave the next rung of the</text><text start="1178.64" dur="5.32">ladder so a couple thousand galaxies</text><text start="1181.799" dur="3.441">where you can measure the distance but</text><text start="1183.96" dur="3.28">that again it&amp;#39;s only a tiny portion of</text><text start="1185.24" dur="4.36">the universe you ever seen these the</text><text start="1187.24" dur="5.12">powers of 10 oh yeah yeah kind of zoom</text><text start="1189.6" dur="2.76">in Zoom</text><text start="1193.52" dur="4.72">yeah so now this is sort of local</text><text start="1195.6" dur="4.88">cluster where where thanks to L you</text><text start="1198.24" dur="3.84">could work about the distances and then</text><text start="1200.48" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s the rest of the</text><text start="1202.08" dur="5.479">universe but it&amp;#39;s enough to get data of</text><text start="1204.32" dur="5.64">some kind yes yes and so Hubble Edwin</text><text start="1207.559" dur="3.881">Hubble was measuring all these galaxies</text><text start="1209.96" dur="3.4">and they have certain spectral lines for</text><text start="1211.44" dur="3.92">example um you know there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text><text start="1213.36" dur="3.16">hydrogen around um each of these um</text><text start="1215.36" dur="2.799">these galaxies and so there&amp;#39;s certain</text><text start="1216.52" dur="3.36">spectral lines of hydrogen that get</text><text start="1218.159" dur="3.361">absorbed and so there&amp;#39;s certain lines</text><text start="1219.88" dur="3.56">that are missing or almost missing in</text><text start="1221.52" dur="3.76">the Spectrum but he noticed that for</text><text start="1223.44" dur="4.44">some of the galaxies the Spectrum was</text><text start="1225.28" dur="5.36">shifted to the red from where it should</text><text start="1227.88" dur="5.12">be but not of them and so he measured it</text><text start="1230.64" dur="5.24">so he measured his red shift against</text><text start="1233" dur="4.52">distance and again he got a linear</text><text start="1235.88" dur="3.799">relationship um there&amp;#39;s actually a</text><text start="1237.52" dur="4.399">famous plot in his paper which is now</text><text start="1239.679" dur="4.201">called H&amp;#39;s law that the red shift is</text><text start="1241.919" dur="3.721">proportional to the distance nowadays we</text><text start="1243.88" dur="3.36">know why this is true is because general</text><text start="1245.64" dur="4.08">relativity predicts that the universe is</text><text start="1247.24" dur="3.919">expanding at at a uniform rate and the</text><text start="1249.72" dur="3.6">further away things are the more they</text><text start="1251.159" dur="4.88">reced and the faster they received about</text><text start="1253.32" dur="4.479">more ship they have but again this is a</text><text start="1256.039" dur="3.561">predictable law so if you have a galaxy</text><text start="1257.799" dur="4.561">far far away</text><text start="1259.6" dur="5.04">if you know um what his red shift is you</text><text start="1262.36" dur="5.319">just measure Spectrum you you apply this</text><text start="1264.64" dur="4.88">law you can walk out of distance so this</text><text start="1267.679" dur="4.161">is the largest rung of the ladder that</text><text start="1269.52" dur="3.759">we know to date the entire bubble of the</text><text start="1271.84" dur="5.8">observable</text><text start="1273.279" dur="7.52">universe which we think is about 20% um</text><text start="1277.64" dur="4.32">of the whole universe we don&amp;#39;t know um</text><text start="1280.799" dur="2.921">pretty much every object in the universe</text><text start="1281.96" dur="3.92">that image light or some sort of</text><text start="1283.72" dur="3.76">radiation uh we can now measure the</text><text start="1285.88" dur="3.52">distance to usually by seeing how</text><text start="1287.48" dur="3.559">spectral lines shift and so you can</text><text start="1289.4" dur="2.72">start mapping things you can do 3D</text><text start="1291.039" dur="3.201">pictures of the universe there something</text><text start="1292.12" dur="4.36">called the SLO Galactic survey which is</text><text start="1294.24" dur="3.919">going to do this for this visualization</text><text start="1296.48" dur="3.72">what I did is read in some data from the</text><text start="1298.159" dur="4.041">Sloan digital Sky survey which</text><text start="1300.2" dur="4.2">Aggregates data about a huge number of</text><text start="1302.2" dur="4.28">galaxies including their angle in the</text><text start="1304.4" dur="4.36">sky and then critically their distance</text><text start="1306.48" dur="3.76">away as measured by Red shift this set</text><text start="1308.76" dur="3.159">doesn&amp;#39;t include all of the angles in the</text><text start="1310.24" dur="3.679">sky that&amp;#39;s why it has this kind of wonky</text><text start="1311.919" dur="3.921">shape this represents about half a</text><text start="1313.919" dur="4.041">million different galaxies visualized as</text><text start="1315.84" dur="4.36">a simple Point cloud and in a sense what</text><text start="1317.96" dur="4.12">you&amp;#39;re looking at is a snapshot of our</text><text start="1320.2" dur="4.32">little corner of the universe measured</text><text start="1322.08" dur="3.24">out to a radius of about 1.6 billion</text><text start="1324.52" dur="3.039">light</text><text start="1325.32" dur="3.64">years and one thing that has been</text><text start="1327.559" dur="3.081">discovered is that galaxies are not just</text><text start="1328.96" dur="3.079">sort of randomly strewn out in space</text><text start="1330.64" dur="3.12">they form these</text><text start="1332.039" dur="4.281">filaments they form these massive</text><text start="1333.76" dur="4.08">structures so a galaxy is itself part of</text><text start="1336.32" dur="3.44">these much larger structures the thing</text><text start="1337.84" dur="4.04">is that&amp;#39;s actually predicted by Theory</text><text start="1339.76" dur="3.84">or at least by experiment so we we can</text><text start="1341.88" dur="4.2">run in a computer billions of virtual</text><text start="1343.6" dur="5.04">galaxies uh Orting by gravity for</text><text start="1346.08" dur="5.479">billions of years and what we have found</text><text start="1348.64" dur="5.68">with simulations is that the galaxies as</text><text start="1351.559" dur="4.801">they um evolve do organize into strands</text><text start="1354.32" dur="4.28">that do resemble the strands that we</text><text start="1356.36" dur="4.84">begin to see so that is in some sense</text><text start="1358.6" dur="4.76">some confirmation that all our theory is</text><text start="1361.2" dur="4.2">basically correct if you&amp;#39;re using red</text><text start="1363.36" dur="4.24">shift what&amp;#39;s the error that&amp;#39;ll give you</text><text start="1365.4" dur="4.879">on the distance that&amp;#39;s a good question</text><text start="1367.6" dur="5.28">it&amp;#39;s hard to calibrate at very large</text><text start="1370.279" dur="4.88">scales because we have very few other</text><text start="1372.88" dur="4.08">ways to measure the distance um the</text><text start="1375.159" dur="3.841">gravitational black hole things those</text><text start="1376.96" dur="3.64">are the uh the most exciting normally to</text><text start="1379" dur="3.559">measure distances at at at this distance</text><text start="1380.6" dur="4">you need to stack together a huge amount</text><text start="1382.559" dur="3.401">of rungs of the ladder first of all the</text><text start="1384.6" dur="2.76">distance of the Sun and then from that</text><text start="1385.96" dur="3.319">parallel act to work out dist to nearby</text><text start="1387.36" dur="3.52">stars and then from that you can work</text><text start="1389.279" dur="2.76">out using main sequence fitting distance</text><text start="1390.88" dur="4.919">to other stars in the galaxy and then</text><text start="1392.039" dur="6.24">Hubble&amp;#39;s Law uh SE between that and then</text><text start="1395.799" dur="3.961">Hubble you can use the gravitational</text><text start="1398.279" dur="3.28">measurements to directly measure the</text><text start="1399.76" dur="3.24">distance unfortunately I I don&amp;#39;t quite</text><text start="1401.559" dur="2.881">remember they&amp;#39;re kind of like standard</text><text start="1403" dur="2.44">Sirens that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re called</text><text start="1404.44" dur="3.08">there&amp;#39;s a certain amount of energy</text><text start="1405.44" dur="4.599">that&amp;#39;s released by a black ho collision</text><text start="1407.52" dur="4.44">and so you know how loud they are in</text><text start="1410.039" dur="3.681">absolute terms and but you can also</text><text start="1411.96" dur="4.079">measure how how loud they are from your</text><text start="1413.72" dur="3.559">Observatory um and they&amp;#39;re billions and</text><text start="1416.039" dur="2.64">billions of times fainter at that point</text><text start="1417.279" dur="2.88">because of the vast distance TR but they</text><text start="1418.679" dur="3.521">can use that to in further distance that</text><text start="1420.159" dur="3.961">they cross checked against the Hubble</text><text start="1422.2"
