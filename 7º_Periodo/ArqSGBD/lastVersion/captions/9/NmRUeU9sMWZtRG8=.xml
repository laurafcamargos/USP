dur="3">I&amp;#39;ve posted since then it is the most</text><text start="10.4" dur="3.52">popular thing that I&amp;#39;ve put on the</text><text start="11.559" dur="4.2">internet and by a pretty wide margin</text><text start="13.92" dur="3.68">this year for Pi Day I want to revisit</text><text start="15.759" dur="3.561">this topic because there&amp;#39;s actually a</text><text start="17.6" dur="4.2">lot that I never talked about in the</text><text start="19.32" dur="4.279">original video including a fact that I</text><text start="21.8" dur="4.2">didn&amp;#39;t know when I first posted it and</text><text start="23.599" dur="3.961">which I suspect no one in the world knew</text><text start="26" dur="4.119">which is how this is all secretly</text><text start="27.56" dur="4.32">connected to Quantum Computing more</text><text start="30.119" dur="4.44">specifically something known as Grover&amp;#39;s</text><text start="31.88" dur="4.28">algorithm for search also the whole</text><text start="34.559" dur="4.32">crowd pleaser is that this is connected</text><text start="36.16" dur="5.12">to Pi but very technically speaking that</text><text start="38.879" dur="4.2">full connection to Pi is an unsolved</text><text start="41.28" dur="4">problem I&amp;#39;ll explain what I mean at the</text><text start="43.079" dur="3.761">end here just to recap in case you</text><text start="45.28" dur="3.88">haven&amp;#39;t seen it the setup of that</text><text start="46.84" dur="4.399">original video was to have two blocks on</text><text start="49.16" dur="3.48">a frictionless plane at the very</text><text start="51.239" dur="3">beginning the one on the left is</text><text start="52.64" dur="4.16">stationary and we&amp;#39;ll think of it is</text><text start="54.239" dur="5.041">smaller maybe 1 kg and the block on the</text><text start="56.8" dur="4.64">right is coming in with some speed the</text><text start="59.28" dur="4.279">two blocks off of each other there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="61.44" dur="4.079">wall to their left and the puzzle is to</text><text start="63.559" dur="3.6">figure out how many total collisions</text><text start="65.519" dur="4.441">would take place including the</text><text start="67.159" dur="4.561">collisions with that wall so for example</text><text start="69.96" dur="4">in the smallest case where both blocks</text><text start="71.72" dur="3.8">have the same mass with each Collision</text><text start="73.96" dur="3.4">all of the momentum gets transferred</text><text start="75.52" dur="3.36">from one block to the other and</text><text start="77.36" dur="4.119">including that one clack against the</text><text start="78.88" dur="5.4">wall the final count is three if that</text><text start="81.479" dur="4.64">right block is bigger maybe 100 kg it</text><text start="84.28" dur="3.879">means it has a lot more momentum when</text><text start="86.119" dur="4.081">it&amp;#39;s coming in so it takes a lot more</text><text start="88.159" dur="4">collisions to fully redirect to that</text><text start="90.2" dur="4.279">momentum in this case with the mass</text><text start="92.159" dur="5.841">ratio of 100 to1 the total number of</text><text start="94.479" dur="6.521">collisions is 31 for an even bigger Mass</text><text start="98" dur="5">ratio let&amp;#39;s say 10,000 to 1 that little</text><text start="101" dur="4.119">block ends up getting really crammed up</text><text start="103" dur="4.2">against the wall and almost all of the</text><text start="105.119" dur="4.441">collisions happen in this rapid burst</text><text start="107.2" dur="2.36">right in the</text><text start="109.68" dur="6.119">middle in this case it takes over 300 in</text><text start="113.04" dur="5.16">total to turn that big block around and</text><text start="115.799" dur="4.841">after a nice long pause as if the</text><text start="118.2" dur="5.279">universe has a strong taste for drum</text><text start="120.64" dur="6.799">we see that the exact answer rolls in at</text><text start="123.479" dur="5.241">314 a number with eerily familiar digits</text><text start="127.439" dur="3.16">I do want to highlight a couple</text><text start="128.72" dur="3.519">unrealistic things about this puzzle the</text><text start="130.599" dur="4.36">kind of nuances you can&amp;#39;t fit into a</text><text start="132.239" dur="4.521">short when this big mass is growing that</text><text start="134.959" dur="3.961">burst of collisions in the middle just</text><text start="136.76" dur="4.199">gets more and more concentrated so in</text><text start="138.92" dur="3.84">order to get the delightful result here</text><text start="140.959" dur="3.881">we have to make a number of idealizing</text><text start="142.76" dur="4">assumptions one assumption is that no</text><text start="144.84" dur="3.64">energy is lost in the collisions</text><text start="146.76" dur="3.64">physicists would call those perfectly</text><text start="148.48" dur="3.68">elastic collisions</text><text start="150.4" dur="3.64">and the astute viewers would then be</text><text start="152.16" dur="2.92">raising their hands and complaining well</text><text start="154.04" dur="3.199">hang on shouldn&amp;#39;t that mean that we</text><text start="155.08" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t hear any sounds and this is true</text><text start="157.239" dur="3.601">I&amp;#39;m throwing in the sounds as an</text><text start="158.44" dur="4.079">artistic Choice partly because I like it</text><text start="160.84" dur="3.479">it makes it kind of fun but more</text><text start="162.519" dur="3.601">substantively I think it&amp;#39;s otherwise</text><text start="164.319" dur="4.081">really hard to communicate purely</text><text start="166.12" dur="4.28">visually just how dense that burst of</text><text start="168.4" dur="3.88">collisions in the middle is like here</text><text start="170.4" dur="3.919">for example with a mass ratio of a</text><text start="172.28" dur="4.48">million to one that burst contains</text><text start="174.319" dur="4.2">almost 3,000 collisions and the final</text><text start="176.76" dur="4.479">count comes in at</text><text start="178.519" dur="4.681">3,141 now as that big Mass gets even</text><text start="181.239" dur="3.92">more massive that little block would</text><text start="183.2" dur="4.24">have to move so quickly during that</text><text start="185.159" dur="4.08">little burst that a physically accurate</text><text start="187.44" dur="4.28">analysis should start to take into</text><text start="189.239" dur="4.441">account relativistic effects and there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="191.72" dur="3.12">just so many other practical realities</text><text start="193.68" dur="3.36">that would cause everything here to</text><text start="194.84" dur="4.399">break down completely but we&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="197.04" dur="4.919">be ignoring all of that we&amp;#39;ll only be</text><text start="199.239" dur="4.441">treating this as a pure overly idealized</text><text start="201.959" dur="4.441">classical physics puzzle because when</text><text start="203.68" dur="5.68">you do the big surprise is that as that</text><text start="206.4" dur="5.8">large mass Grows by powers of 100 the</text><text start="209.36" dur="4.519">total number of collisions always has</text><text start="212.2" dur="4.56">the same digits as</text><text start="213.879" dur="5.36">Pi now even if this gets unrealistic for</text><text start="216.76" dur="4.64">big Mass ratios you can actually see it</text><text start="219.239" dur="3.72">in practice for smaller ratios this</text><text start="221.4" dur="3.119">footage here for example comes from a</text><text start="222.959" dur="3.761">group of students at the University of</text><text start="224.519" dur="5.36">bond demonstrating how when the mass</text><text start="226.72" dur="5.56">ratio is 100 to1 you really do get 31</text><text start="229.879" dur="4.56">collisions also Matt Parker just put up</text><text start="232.28" dur="4.64">a video about the attempts that he and I</text><text start="234.439" dur="5.401">and a couple others had to do so at</text><text start="236.92" dur="5.12">Cambridge like I said this pure puzzle</text><text start="239.84" dur="3.959">realistic though it might be is secretly</text><text start="242.04" dur="3.919">connected to Quantum Computing and</text><text start="243.799" dur="3.681">believe it or not studying this I think</text><text start="245.959" dur="3.12">puts you in a good position to</text><text start="247.48" dur="3.72">understand what Quantum Computing even</text><text start="249.079" dur="3.761">is as a little bit of foreshadowing some</text><text start="251.2" dur="3.56">of you might have been wondering why it</text><text start="252.84" dur="4.6">is that to see Pi you have to increase</text><text start="254.76" dur="4.96">by powers of 100 as opposed to powers of</text><text start="257.44" dur="4.359">10 since we work in base 10 maybe that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="259.72" dur="4.52">what you would expect and the answer to</text><text start="261.799" dur="4.68">that question is intimately connected</text><text start="264.24" dur="4.36">with the fact that for quantum computers</text><text start="266.479" dur="4.121">search algorithms can be faster

thing</text><text start="279.08" dur="4.2">is the only way this has any hope of</text><text start="281.32" dur="3.719">making sense is if you already have the</text><text start="283.28"

aside from</text><text start="334.919" dur="3.761">the surprising pie of course is how well</text><text start="336.96" dur="4.12">poised it is to be a general</text><text start="338.68" dur="3.799">problemsolving lesson very often when I</text><text start="341.08" dur="3.48">present this as a lecture I like to</text><text start="342.479" dur="4.041">start by inviting the audience to begin</text><text start="344.56" dur="3.96">by listing out a few General problem</text><text start="346.52" dur="3.84">solving principles you might enjoy</text><text start="348.52" dur="3.64">thinking of a few of your own and as we</text><text start="350.36" dur="4.2">go through I&amp;#39;ll highlight a couple that</text><text start="352.16" dur="3.8">I have written down here for example one</text><text start="354.56" dur="3.359">that&amp;#39;s seemingly trivial but</text><text start="355.96" dur="3.88">surprisingly useful is that if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="357.919" dur="3.961">stuck on a hard problem and I I would</text><text start="359.84" dur="4.199">consider this a hard problem it never</text><text start="361.88" dur="4.52">hurts to just list any equations or</text><text start="364.039" dur="3.841">theorems that might somehow be relevant</text><text start="366.4" dur="3.68">so for this puzzle where we have some</text><text start="367.88" dur="4.159">colliding blocks two relevant laws that</text><text start="370.08" dur="3.679">might come to mind especially if you</text><text start="372.039" dur="3.801">have a recent physics class somewhere in</text><text start="373.759" dur="4.72">your history would be the conservation</text><text start="375.84" dur="4.759">of energy and the conservation of</text><text start="378.479" dur="4.921">momentum the energy of one of these</text><text start="380.599" dur="5.081">moving blocks would be 1/2 * its mass</text><text start="383.4" dur="4.68">time its velocity squared so let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="385.68" dur="5.12">we call the mass of the big block M1 and</text><text start="388.08" dur="4.839">call its velocity V1 1 and likewise the</text><text start="390.8" dur="5">mass of that little block will be M2 and</text><text start="392.919" dur="4.801">its everchanging velocity will be V2</text><text start="395.8" dur="3.679">then the total kinetic energy between</text><text start="397.72" dur="3.64">these two blocks is what you get by</text><text start="399.479" dur="4">plugging in the numbers and adding these</text><text start="401.36" dur="4.32">two quantities the conservation of</text><text start="403.479" dur="4.12">energy essentially says this number</text><text start="405.68" dur="4">won&amp;#39;t change throughout the experiment</text><text start="407.599" dur="3.681">those two velocities will change but</text><text start="409.68" dur="3.2">they have to do so in such a way that</text><text start="411.28" dur="3.759">this whole expression equals the same</text><text start="412.88" dur="4.36">number this is all of course assuming</text><text start="415.039" dur="3">that no energy is lost to friction or to</text><text start="417.24" dur="2.959">the</text><text start="418.039" dur="4.681">collisions the other quantity that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="420.199" dur="4.521">conserved is momentum and the momentum</text><text start="422.72" dur="4.479">for each block looks even simpler it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="424.72" dur="4">just its mass times its velocity so</text><text start="427.199" dur="3.601">again when you plug in the numbers and</text><text start="428.72" dur="3.96">you compute this expression you&amp;#39;ll get</text><text start="430.8" dur="4.119">something and what the conservation of</text><text start="432.68" dur="4.56">momentum tells us is that whatever that</text><text start="434.919" dur="4.081">number is it doesn&amp;#39;t change even after</text><text start="437.24" dur="4.679">the blocks collide with each</text><text start="439" dur="5.12">other now unlike energy this momentum</text><text start="441.919" dur="3.68">expression will actually change after</text><text start="444.12" dur="3.4">that little block collides against the</text><text start="445.599" dur="3.72">wall cuz really what&amp;#39;s going on is it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="447.52" dur="3.64">transferring some of its momentum into</text><text start="449.319" dur="3.28">that wall technically speaking that</text><text start="451.16" dur="3.08">should mean the wall starts moving a</text><text start="452.599" dur="3.401">tiny amount but again we&amp;#39;ll be</text><text start="454.24" dur="4">idealistic and assume the wall is super</text><text start="456" dur="4.039">massive or fixed into the Earth and any</text><text start="458.24" dur="4">movement that it has is</text><text start="460.039" dur="4.321">negligible another principle I have up</text><text start="462.24" dur="3.72">here is to just draw pictures when</text><text start="464.36" dur="3.76">you&amp;#39;re trying to figure something out</text><text start="465.96" dur="3.72">actually make some figures visual</text><text start="468.12" dur="3.479">intuition can help to think about things</text><text start="469.68" dur="3.479">in different ways and sometimes staring</text><text start="471.599" dur="3.88">at the right diagram can expose a</text><text start="473.159" dur="4.681">solution so in this context where the</text><text start="475.479" dur="4.56">two values that are changing are V1 and</text><text start="477.84" dur="4">V2 you might be inspired to draw a</text><text start="480.039" dur="3.961">coordinate plane where the x coordinate</text><text start="481.84" dur="5.28">encodes this value V1 and the</text><text start="484" dur="5.479">y-coordinate encodes this value</text><text start="487.12" dur="4.759">V2 just to be crystal clear on what I</text><text start="489.479" dur="4.041">mean by that as the experiment unfolds</text><text start="491.879" dur="3.481">and the blocks collide with each other</text><text start="493.52" dur="4.16">and their two velocities change with</text><text start="495.36" dur="4.279">each Collision this little Point inside</text><text start="497.68" dur="4.359">our space is going to move around that</text><text start="499.639" dur="4.28">space as those two velocities change</text><text start="502.039" dur="5.241">always doing so in such a way that its</text><text

dur="3.279">you&amp;#39;ll see how this is true let&amp;#39;s take a</text><text start="683.079" dur="3.481">minute to get a little familiar with</text><text start="684.519" dur="4">what this diagram is really telling us</text><text start="686.56" dur="4.64">for example at the very beginning that</text><text start="688.519" dur="4.401">big block has a negative velocity so we</text><text start="691.2" dur="3.759">must be somewhere on this left half of</text><text start="692.92" dur="4.2">the plane and that little block starts</text><text start="694.959" dur="4.361">off stationary meaning the y-coordinate</text><text start="697.12" dur="4.279">is zero and so we have to start out at</text><text start="699.32" dur="4.12">the leftmost point of this circle that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="701.399" dur="4.041">the initial condition now after they</text><text start="703.44" dur="3.839">collide with each other what happens</text><text start="705.44" dur="3.24">where do we end up well physical</text><text start="707.279" dur="3.161">intuition tells us that that little</text><text start="708.68" dur="3.2">block picks up some kind of negative</text><text start="710.44" dur="3.16">velocity so we&amp;#39;re going to have to end</text><text start="711.88" dur="3.84">up somewhere where the y-coordinate is</text><text start="713.6" dur="4.08">negative and that big block loses some</text><text start="715.72" dur="3.88">of its momentum so the x coordinate is</text><text start="717.68" dur="3.44">going to get a little closer to Z from</text><text start="719.6" dur="3.679">where it was even if you don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="721.12" dur="4.04">exactly how much and again we have to</text><text start="723.279" dur="3.481">stay somewhere on this circle the circle</text><text start="725.16" dur="3.96">represents all the points that have the</text><text start="726.76" dur="4.12">same total energy and so you might guess</text><text start="729.12" dur="5.159">that our Point lands somewhere on like</text><text start="730.88" dur="4.759">this Arc right here to be more exact we</text><text start="734.279" dur="3.24">need to introduce the second</text><text start="735.639" dur="3.76">conservation law the conservation of</text><text start="737.519" dur="3.32">momentum keep in mind though at this</text><text start="739.399" dur="3.961">point I&amp;#39;ve changed what the coordinates</text><text start="740.839" dur="4.201">mean so in our new coordinates the</text><text start="743.36"

dur="3.759">coordinate system and those masses are</text><text start="755.199" dur="4.041">just constants anyway the significance</text><text start="757.079" dur="4.76">is that this whole equation is a linear</text><text start="759.24" dur="3.88">equation in X and Y so in our diagram</text><text start="761.839" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;s going to look like some kind of</text><text start="763.12"

start="804.04" dur="3.799">this line intersects The Circle at</text><text start="805.68" dur="4.44">exactly two places meaning there are</text><text start="807.839" dur="4.081">only two pairs of

start="838.36" dur="4.2">caused a change in the net momentum</text><text start="840.56" dur="3.88">since some of it went into the wall so</text><text start="842.56" dur="3.839">our momentum line

dur="3.399">new point and then when the blocks</text><text start="849.56" dur="4.04">bounce off each other again we look for</text><text start="851.399" dur="4.641">the other place where that diagonal line</text><text start="853.6" dur="4.039">intersects the circle and you basically</text><text start="856.04" dur="3.08">keep playing this game little block</text><text start="857.639"

dur="4">drawing a slope of four but it could be</text><text start="919.92" dur="4.32">anything and then you move straight up</text><text start="922.24" dur="3.719">until you intersect the circle and then</text><text start="924.24" dur="3.68">down and to the right with that same</text><text start="925.959" dur="4.201">slope then straight up down and to the</text><text start="927.92" dur="5.039">right over and over over until you end</text><text start="930.16" dur="4.679">up inside this end zone the puzzle is</text><text start="932.959" dur="3.841">how many lines do you draw how

dur="4.199">the slope if you have a steeper slope</text><text start="941.48" dur="3.64">you end up with more Total Lines and the</text><text start="943.639" dur="3.88">one connection that we have to the</text><text start="945.12" dur="4.36">original physics is that the slope comes</text><text start="947.519" dur="4.24">from the negative square root of the</text><text start="949.48" dur="4.88">mass ratio for example when the big mass</text><text start="951.759" dur="4.721">is 100 and the little mass is one that</text><text start="954.36" dur="5.279">square root of the mass ratio looks like</text><text start="956.48" dur="5.719">10 so the slope is -10 and in fact we do</text><text start="959.639" dur="4.64">get 31 lines corresponding to the 31</text><text start="962.199"
