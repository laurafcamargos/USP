for you know</text><text start="243.2" dur="4.039">a little bit like every 6 months when I</text><text start="245.159" dur="4">had a new idea I eventually came up with</text><text start="247.239" dur="5.121">an algorithm that was able to take 21</text><text start="249.159" dur="5.241">steps backwards in three or four weeks</text><text start="252.36" dur="3.519">of compute time that final algorithm</text><text start="254.4" dur="2.799">weirdly enough was actually single</text><text start="255.879" dur="3.681">threaded so I could have made 12</text><text start="257.199"

start="272.8" dur="4">don&amp;#39;t want to get into the forwards game</text><text start="274.24" dur="5.12">of life too much because there are so</text><text start="276.8" dur="4.76">many really

start="283.12" dur="3.76">life cuz it&amp;#39;s cool but if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="284.56" dur="5.079">unfamiliar here are the rules to travel</text><text start="286.88" dur="5.36">from one iteration to the next any live</text><text start="289.639" dur="4.641">cell with either two or three neighbors</text><text start="292.24" dur="5.2">remains alive like this cell or this</text><text

this cell any living</text><text start="303.16" dur="5.44">cell with more than three neighbors dies</text><text start="305.479" dur="6.041">of overpopulation like this cell and any</text><text start="308.6" dur="5.92">dead cell with exactly three Neighbors</text><text start="311.52" dur="5.04">comes to life like both of these all the</text><text start="314.52" dur="3.72">rest of the cells that start dead either</text><text start="316.56" dur="4.04">have too many neighbors to come to life</text><text start="318.24" dur="4.48">or too few so from one iteration to the</text><text start="320.6" dur="4.48">next they remain dead I like to shrink</text><text start="322.72" dur="4.24">these four and a half rules down to two</text><text start="325.08" dur="3.88">it feels a little redundant to describe</text><text start="326.96" dur="3.799">the cells that die when you can build up</text><text start="328.96" dur="3.88">a new board from Scratch by retaining</text><text start="330.759" dur="3.681">some cells and adding some cells having</text><text start="332.84" dur="3.88">as few rules as possible that you can</text><text start="334.44" dur="4.64">state in the

start="341.56" dur="4.8">two rules that describe how one</text><text start="343.56" dur="4.639">iteration moves to the next control all</text><text start="346.36" dur="3.839">of the amazing complexity and the</text><text start="348.199" dur="3.601">structures formed in Conway&amp;#39;s Game of</text><text start="350.199" dur="4.28">Life because there&amp;#39;s such a hard and</text><text

different hard and</text><text start="360.4" dur="4.32">fast set of rules that takes a pattern</text><text start="362.6" dur="5.719">and advances it one step backwards in</text><text start="364.72" dur="5.879">time but there&amp;#39;s not there is no way to</text><text start="368.319" dur="4.16">reliably compute this pattern when you</text><text start="370.599" dur="3.641">start with this pattern in fact if we</text><text start="372.479" dur="3.84">put a random pattern over here just a</text><text start="374.24" dur="4.6">random arrangement of pixels we can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="376.319" dur="5.16">even be certain that a previous pattern</text><text start="378.84" dur="4.52">exists let alone being able to compute</text><text start="381.479" dur="3.801">that pattern in a reasonable amount of</text><text start="383.36" dur="3.92">time if you watched my video a few years</text><text start="385.28" dur="3.84">ago about using a Monte Carlo algorithm</text><text start="387.28" dur="5.08">to Jerry Mander the state of North</text><text start="389.12" dur="5.28">Carolina that was a comparatively easy</text><text start="392.36" dur="3.72">computational problem to solve so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="394.4" dur="4.16">going to try to explain why the reverse</text><text start="396.08" dur="3.959">game of life is so much more difficult</text><text start="398.56" dur="3.479">than Jerry mandering the state of North</text><text start="400.039" dur="4.121">Carolina and to do that I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="402.039" dur="4.641">start by explaining how I like to think</text><text start="404.16" dur="4.84">about these problems as a search through</text><text start="406.68" dur="4.4">a high-dimensional configuration space</text><text start="409" dur="3.479">or if you want to get really fancy a</text><text start="411.08" dur="4.04">configuration</text><text start="412.479" dur="3.56">hyperspace which is really not as

dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s not configuration spaces or phase</text><text start="427.16" dur="4.319">spaces or whatever you want to call them</text><text start="428.639" dur="5.12">are really important and that&amp;#39;s for at</text><text start="431.479" dur="4.72">least two different reasons the first</text><text start="433.759" dur="5.041">off is just general scientific thinking</text><text start="436.199" dur="4.921">no joke the other day at work somebody</text><text start="438.8" dur="4.04">proposed skipping an experiment out of a</text><text start="441.12" dur="3.88">long sequence of experiments and in</text><text start="442.84" dur="4.68">agreement I pointed at the ground said</text><text start="445" dur="4.639">oh there&amp;#39;s our phase Bas and then MIM</text><text start="447.52" dur="3.56">taking like a really big step forward</text><text start="449.639" dur="2.84">like we&amp;#39;re skipping all of these</text><text start="451.08" dur="3.44">experiments that would be in this other</text><text start="452.479" dur="4.481">part of the solution space and they</text><text start="454.52" dur="4.2">laugh now they may just laugh because</text><text start="456.96" dur="4.16">they&amp;#39;re humoring me at this point but</text><text start="458.72" dur="5.64">they at least knew what I meant so this</text><text start="461.12" dur="5.84">sort of thinking in Phase space or this</text><text start="464.36" dur="5.04">very large space of possibilities is</text><text start="466.96" dur="4.6">just sort of how scientists look at</text><text start="469.4"

that</text><text start="1978.44" dur="4.88">again and we can do that again and</text><text start="1980.279" dur="4.441">eventually it fails to solve this means</text><text start="1983.32" dur="3.079">that within the constraints that we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="1984.72" dur="3.12">given it with like the sizing and how</text><text start="1986.399" dur="4.041">many pixels are allowed

dur="3.561">Child&amp;#39;s Play at this point we can take</text><text start="2005.08" dur="3.28">one step backwards what if we just take</text><text start="2006.84" dur="3.76">one of these simulations</text><text start="2008.36" dur="4">bring it over here and then run the Z3</text><text start="2010.6" dur="3.16">solver again well we can do that and</text><text start="2012.36" dur="5.159">then we do it again and then we do it</text><text start="2013.76" dur="7.44">again and then we do it again but</text><text start="2017.519" dur="5.321">oh wait it broke yeah So eventually it</text><text start="2021.2" dur="4">stops solving and then there&amp;#39;s an</text><text start="2022.84" dur="3.959">entirely new set of problems so that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2025.2"
