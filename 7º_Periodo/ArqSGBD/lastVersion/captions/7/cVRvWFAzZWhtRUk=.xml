dur="5.52">stars and these are all parts of the</text><text start="46.76" dur="4.71">universe as a whole and it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="49.07" dur="5.239">important that we treat them as parts of</text><text start="51.47" dur="5.729">a larger universe so that for example</text><text start="54.309" dur="5.381">where they are or how much energy they</text><text start="57.199" dur="4.77">have is to find relative to the rest of</text><text start="59.69" dur="6.66">the universe that&amp;#39;s outside the system</text><text start="61.969" dur="7.65">so the very way we describe parts of the</text><text start="66.35" dur="6.45">universe as related to the rest of the</text><text start="69.619" dur="5.841">universe is characteristic of the method</text><text start="72.8" dur="6.69">by which we describe nature in physics</text><text start="75.46" dur="6.28">and when we raise our ambition and we</text><text start="79.49" dur="5.519">come to the question of the universe as</text><text start="81.74" dur="5.46">a whole or a question that is about the</text><text start="85.009" dur="5.041">whole story of the whole universe like</text><text start="87.2" dur="4.949">the big burner have you ever started or</text><text start="90.05" dur="3.629">what was before the Big Bang we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="92.149" dur="4.231">dealing for the first time with the</text><text start="93.679" dur="5.401">question of how to describe and make a</text><text start="96.38" dur="5.939">theory of the universe as a whole and</text><text start="99.08" dur="5.459">this is a very different kind of theory</text><text start="102.319" dur="3.69">a very different kind of questions and</text><text start="104.539" dur="5.03">the questions we used to dealing with</text><text start="106.009" dur="6.871">and therefore it&amp;#39;s important to stop and</text><text start="109.569" dur="5.381">meditate for a while on what it means to</text><text start="112.88" dur="5.12">make a theory of the universe or any</text><text start="114.95" dur="3.05">system as a whole</text><text start="121.52" dur="6.87">when we describe a star we do reference</text><text start="125.99" dur="5.13">it wouldn&amp;#39;t describe it with respect to</text><text start="128.39" dur="4.98">things outside of it we describe its</text><text start="131.12" dur="4.949">position relative to the position of an</text><text start="133.37" dur="4.77">observer who&amp;#39;s outside of the star when</text><text start="136.069" dur="4.14">we describe its motion we&amp;#39;re describing</text><text start="138.14" dur="4.41">its motion relative to something outside</text><text start="140.209" dur="4.951">of it and so on</text><text start="142.55" dur="5.67">and that works that&amp;#39;s the legitimate way</text><text start="145.16" dur="5.01">to do science except for when we come to</text><text start="148.22" dur="5.19">the case of the universe as a whole and</text><text start="150.17" dur="5.52">then we have to describe a system that</text><text start="153.41" dur="4.62">contains everything there is nothing</text><text start="155.69" dur="4.71">outside the universe and there therefore</text><text start="158.03" dur="5.04">is nothing to describe the universe with</text><text start="160.4" dur="6">reference to and this means we need a</text><text start="163.07" dur="5.25">very different kind of structure a range</text><text start="166.4" dur="4.77">of a kind of method a different kind of</text><text start="168.32" dur="5.54">theory when we come to study the</text><text start="171.17" dur="2.69">universe as a whole</text><text start="175.23" dur="7.56">because there&amp;#39;s a tradition of thinking</text><text start="178.61" dur="7.15">deeply seriously and critically that</text><text start="182.79" dur="7.14">goes back centuries which is what you</text><text start="185.76" dur="6.69">learn when you study philosophy now if</text><text start="189.93" dur="5.279">you&amp;#39;re not interested in a fundamental</text><text start="192.45" dur="5.34">question like the nature of time or what</text><text start="195.209" dur="4.89">is matter or the nature of the universe</text><text start="197.79" dur="7.08">as a whole but you just want to apply</text><text start="200.099" dur="7.5">known laws to known phenomena to</text><text start="204.87" dur="6.869">understand the better to understand the</text><text start="207.599" dur="8.301">behavior of a solid or the gas or a star</text><text start="211.739" dur="6.631">or something isolated like that you can</text><text start="215.9" dur="5.44">proceed without much knowledge of</text><text start="218.37" dur="6.99">philosophy you can proceed pragmatically</text><text start="221.34" dur="7.709">we like to say but if you want to ask</text><text start="225.36" dur="6.689">the really deep questions there are</text><text start="229.049" dur="5.821">these traditions of human beings</text><text start="232.049" dur="6.3">grappling with the same questions they</text><text start="234.87" dur="6.42">go back hundreds of years and not only</text><text start="238.349" dur="5.911">is it good to know them because it gives</text><text start="241.29" dur="4.89">you a storehouse of ideas it allows you</text><text start="244.26" dur="4.8">to understand your own thinking because</text><text start="246.18" dur="5.88">what you discover is that unless you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="249.06" dur="6.12">extraordinarily special and unusual your</text><text start="252.06" dur="9.079">thinking is shaped by the philosophical</text><text start="255.18" dur="5.959">legacy that underlies our
