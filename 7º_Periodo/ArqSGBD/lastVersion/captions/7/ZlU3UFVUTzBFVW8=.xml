dur="4.32">making art from thermite I have a uh a</text><text start="40.6" dur="3.32">couple pieces that were just hanging on</text><text start="42" dur="6.239">my wall until recently when I moved back</text><text start="43.92" dur="7.52">here but in that video I mentioned that</text><text start="48.239" dur="5.12">the reaction of thermite is of course</text><text start="51.44" dur="3.759">not an explosive and it&amp;#39;s actually a a</text><text start="53.359" dur="4.961">reasonably slow reaction and I said that</text><text start="55.199" dur="5.561">it would slowly consume a a pile of</text><text start="58.32" dur="4.399">powder and since then I&amp;#39;ve wondered how</text><text start="60.76" dur="3.84">quickly the reaction front moves through</text><text start="62.719" dur="3.44">thermite and it&amp;#39;s something that I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="64.6" dur="2.519">about to test which I&amp;#39;m very excited</text><text start="66.159" dur="3.081">about because I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about</text><text start="67.119" dur="5.921">this experiment for a while so I just</text><text start="69.24" dur="6.879">finished packing thermite into some uh</text><text start="73.04" dur="6.439">borosilicate tubes so this borosilicate</text><text start="76.119" dur="5.441">Glass is very high melting point</text><text start="79.479" dur="3.921">somewhere around 300 degre or 3,000</text><text start="81.56" dur="4.919">degrees Fahrenheit which means that it</text><text start="83.4" dur="5.2">will melt when the thermite goes off but</text><text start="86.479" dur="3.801">it should hold together for long enough</text><text start="88.6" dur="3.799">that we can actually see the reaction</text><text start="90.28" dur="3.879">front moving through the material if we</text><text start="92.399" dur="4">light it at this end and let it let the</text><text start="94.159" dur="4.081">reaction progress and I think that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="96.399" dur="3.641">going to be a really cool thing to see</text><text start="98.24" dur="4.919">the other thing about borosilicate glass</text><text start="100.04" dur="4.92">is that it has a very high or a very low</text><text start="103.159" dur="3.761">thermal coefficient of expansion</text><text start="104.96" dur="4.159">relative to most other glasses which</text><text start="106.92" dur="3.839">means that it has a very high resistance</text><text start="109.119" dur="3.201">to Thermal shock which means that when</text><text start="110.759" dur="6.241">we light this and it goes from room</text><text start="112.32" dur="7.04">temperature to uh 4,000 de fahit I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="117" dur="3.64">hoping that it will not just shatter so</text><text start="119.36" dur="4.16">that&amp;#39;s the first thing we got to find</text><text start="120.64" dur="5.159">out so I waited until it had recently</text><text start="123.52" dur="4.44">rained to do this project so that the</text><text start="125.799" dur="4.44">surroundings are relatively safe I have</text><text start="127.96" dur="4.12">a hose right there sitting by for a</text><text start="130.239" dur="3.921">worst case scenario in case I need to</text><text start="132.08" dur="5.519">extinguish anything around the</text><text start="134.16" dur="6.56">experiment myself I&amp;#39;m protected because</text><text start="137.599" dur="5.481">I have uh safety glasses that are rated</text><text start="140.72" dur="4.64">for blocking out UV and infrared</text><text start="143.08" dur="3.799">radiation so the really intense light</text><text start="145.36" dur="2.84">that comes off of the burning magnesium</text><text start="146.879" dur="3.601">and thermite should not be able to hurt</text><text start="148.2" dur="5.6">my eyes I also have sleep leaves to</text><text start="150.48" dur="4.92">protect against any sort of shards or</text><text start="153.8" dur="3.32">splatters that come off that could be</text><text start="155.4" dur="4.44">hot and if I need to pick anything up</text><text start="157.12" dur="5.72">I&amp;#39;ve got like a real glove over here so</text><text start="159.84" dur="6.96">I have a lot of work experience around</text><text start="162.84" dur="7">hot equipment and uh high temperature</text><text start="166.8" dur="5.4">things so it is possible to deal with</text><text start="169.84" dur="4.16">things like thermite safely but for this</text><text start="172.2" dur="3.759">particular experiment with a semi</text><text start="174" dur="4.4">confined reaction it&amp;#39;s probably</text><text start="175.959" dur="4.2">something you shouldn&amp;#39;t try at home so</text><text start="178.4" dur="4.4">this first test is just to make sure</text><text start="180.159" dur="5.521">that when thermite goes off inside of</text><text start="182.8" dur="6.12">one of these Pyrex tubes it doesn&amp;#39;t like</text><text start="185.68" dur="6.08">explode or crack or do anything uh</text><text start="188.92" dur="2.84">dangerously</text><text start="206.239" dur="5.521">violent come</text><text start="208.239" dur="3.521">on darn it</text><text start="224.68" dur="3.08">it will not go down that</text><text start="229.84" dur="4.479">tube so I&amp;#39;ve tried now multiple times to</text><text start="232.519" dur="3.601">light thermite in one of those tubes and</text><text start="234.319" dur="3.76">I think that the crosssection the the</text><text start="236.12" dur="4.319">area of thermite available to burn is</text><text start="238.079" dur="3.88">just too small to sustain the Rea action</text><text start="240.439" dur="5.321">even when I&amp;#39;ve gotten thermite on the</text><text start="241.959" dur="4.801">end to burn and you can see this one</text><text start="245.76" dur="4">there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="246.76" dur="5.839">actually a little bit of iron down in</text><text start="249.76" dur="5.36">the tube but it didn&amp;#39;t actually continue</text><text start="252.599" dur="4.681">and burn the rest of the tube so from</text><text start="255.12" dur="4.079">the previous experiments it&amp;#39;s clear that</text><text start="257.28" dur="5.479">a rapid heating on the top of the tube</text><text start="259.199" dur="4.801">isn&amp;#39;t going to cause uh severe shock</text><text start="262.759" dur="4.321">although I wasn&amp;#39;t able to get the</text><text start="264" dur="5.199">reaction to progress through the tube so</text><text start="267.08" dur="4.52">I&amp;#39;m now using a larger tube and this is</text><text start="269.199" dur="3.961">going to be the the real take I guess</text><text start="271.6" dur="4.439">I&amp;#39;m going to set the camera all the way</text><text start="273.16" dur="5.039">to its lowest ISO and lowest exposure</text><text start="276.039" dur="4.561">and uh I have it all set up with a tube</text><text start="278.199" dur="5.241">running vertically it&amp;#39;s a wider diameter</text><text start="280.6" dur="4.48">tube and I have the uh MythBusters Z</text><text start="283.44" dur="3.08">tape stripes going down one of the</text><text start="285.08" dur="3.2">bricks that one inch increment so I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="286.52" dur="6.119">be able to measure exactly how quickly</text><text start="288.28" dur="4.359">the reaction is moving through the tube</text><text start="302" dur="5.919">this is ridiculous this monstrosity of a</text><text start="305.68" dur="4.359">tube this is the largest Siz tube I have</text><text start="307.919" dur="4.601">so I&amp;#39;m hoping that it</text><text start="310.039" dur="5.041">works here we go we have the largest</text><text start="312.52" dur="4.32">tube full of thermite and I&amp;#39;m only going</text><text start="315.08" dur="3.16">to light the bottom half it for now if</text><text start="316.84" dur="3.12">it works really well I might mix more</text><text start="318.24" dur="2.959">and try a lateral shot but you know at</text><text start="319.96" dur="5.2">this point I&amp;#39;m just going to be happy if</text><text start="321.199" dur="3.961">I can get it to burn in a tube</text><text start="337" dur="3.4">all the pl</text><text start="374.72" dur="6.24">so I just came back a couple days later</text><text start="377.479" dur="6.321">to retrieve the pieces of tube that I</text><text start="380.96" dur="7.079">actually had the thermite burn through</text><text start="383.8" dur="6">and uh I was very wrong about the speed</text><text start="388.039" dur="3.641">of the reaction front I was was</text><text start="389.8" dur="4.48">expecting it to like ZIP down through</text><text start="391.68" dur="5.16">the tube and I actually had the camera</text><text start="394.28" dur="6.08">set to record in in high speed so I was</text><text start="396.84" dur="6.16">going at 120 frames per second but it</text><text start="400.36" dur="5.8">was only the reaction was actually only</text><text start="403" dur="6.88">moving at 14 in per minute it took like</text><text start="406.16" dur="6.68">40 seconds for the uh reaction to move</text><text start="409.88" dur="5.4">all the way through the tube and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="412.84" dur="4.16">really slow if you look at like high</text><text start="415.28" dur="4.8">explosives they can go at tens of</text><text start="417" dur="6.199">thousands of feet per second so this 14</text><text start="420.08" dur="5.839">in per minute it&amp;#39;s substantially</text><text start="423.199" dur="4.081">different so I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting it to be</text><text start="425.919" dur="3.081">like high explosive because I know that</text><text start="427.28" dur="4.12">thermite isn&amp;#39;t an explosive but I was</text><text start="429" dur="4.12">expecting it to go faster than it did so</text><text start="431.4" dur="3.12">I&amp;#39;m glad that I did the test that&amp;#39;s I</text><text start="433.12" dur="2.6">guess why we&amp;#39;ve got to be scientific</text><text start="434.52" dur="3.28">about these things and actually go</text><text start="435.72" dur="3.199">figure it out because my intuition was</text><text start="437.8" dur="4.2">very</text><text start="438.919" dur="5.041">wrong I did however notice that towards</text><text start="442" dur="3.879">the top of the tube the reaction</text><text start="443.96" dur="5.679">occurred really quickly and it appeared</text><text start="445.879" dur="5.201">to slow down as it progressed and I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="449.639" dur="3.361">attributing that to the fact that the</text><text start="451.08" dur="3.48">thermite at the top was probably packed</text><text start="453" dur="3.24">a little tighter where I had to like</text><text start="454.56" dur="6.079">shove the magnesium in and stuff like</text><text start="456.24" dur="6.2">that so my current hypothesis is that by</text><text start="460.639" dur="3.881">densifying the thermite and actually</text><text start="462.44" dur="4">packing it in I&amp;#39;ll be able to make the</text><text start="464.52" dur="4.519">reaction go a little faster so I have a</text><text start="466.44" dur="5.56">new batch of thermite and I have a</text><text start="469.039" dur="4.44">pusher here that fits in the tube so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="472" dur="4.72">going to try to pack it like a rocket</text><text start="473.479" dur="7.961">motor and really get the powder dense</text><text start="476.72" dur="4.72">and see if that has any effect find out</text><text start="495.56" dur="4.72">so I guess this is going to be the</text><text start="496.84" dur="6.639">densified thermite test I have uh a tube</text><text start="500.28" dur="4.96">here that&amp;#39;s full and uh it is actually</text><text start="503.479" dur="3.521">tamped down so there&amp;#39;s no more air if</text><text start="505.24" dur="5.919">you press the top of this it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="507" dur="5.68">puff up at all and uh I&amp;#39;m hoping that</text><text start="511.159" dur="3.721">this is going to make the reaction go</text><text start="512.68" dur="3.12">faster but you know last time I guessed</text><text start="514.88" dur="4.399">wrong</text><text start="515.8" dur="3.479">so it&amp;#39;ll be an</text><text start="523.76" dur="6.44">experiment that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="525.92" dur="4.28">incredible it&amp;#39;s crawling</text><text start="544.32" dur="4.24">so I was wrong on two fronts I thought</text><text start="547.12" dur="3.44">that the thermite reaction would go a</text><text start="548.56" dur="4.16">lot faster than it did and then I also</text><text start="550.56" dur="3.839">thought that I could speed it up by</text><text start="552.72" dur="4.52">making the thermite denser and packing</text><text start="554.399" dur="4.761">it together as it turns out both of</text><text start="557.24" dur="3.64">those assumptions were wrong and I guess</text><text start="559.16" dur="3.76">I&amp;#39;m glad I did the experiment because</text><text start="560.88" dur="4.92">without actually testing it I had no way</text><text start="562.92" dur="5.32">of knowing that so the thermite reaction</text><text start="565.8" dur="4.84">you can see sort of happens in spurts</text><text start="568.24" dur="5.12">and it&amp;#39;s very much a a little bit of</text><text start="570.64" dur="5.04">thermite powder reacts it heats up and</text><text start="573.36" dur="4.039">then it waits a minute before the next</text><text start="575.68" dur="4.92">bit of thermite powder gets hot enough</text><text start="577.399" dur="4.88">to react and I was originally thinking</text><text start="580.6" dur="3.44">that the problem and the reason that it</text><text start="582.279" dur="4.24">wasn&amp;#39;t reacting as quickly as I thought</text><text start="584.04" dur="4.64">it would was that the heat from the</text><text start="586.519" dur="5.961">reacting thermite was not getting to the</text><text start="588.68" dur="5.52">unreacted thermite fast enough and that</text><text start="592.48" dur="3.479">be if you packed the powder together</text><text start="594.2" dur="3.48">more closely that every time some</text><text start="595.959" dur="4">thermite went off it would be right next</text><text start="597.68" dur="3.719">to another piece of thermite and that</text><text start="599.959" dur="3.32">that would cause the reaction to</text><text start="601.399" dur="4.401">progress very quickly but that was not</text><text start="603.279" dur="5.201">the case instead it appears that the</text><text start="605.8" dur="6.68">limiting factor in the reaction front</text><text start="608.48" dur="7.44">movement in thermite powder is actually</text><text start="612.48" dur="6.599">heat being sucked away too quickly now</text><text start="615.92" dur="5.479">when you when these uh reactions occur</text><text start="619.079" dur="3.841">in a tube the way that I&amp;#39;ve done here</text><text start="621.399" dur="3.56">when you&amp;#39;re done you actually end up</text><text start="622.92" dur="3.919">with this cool little iron tube with</text><text start="624.959" dur="4.161">like perfectly smooth insides it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="626.839" dur="3.961">really neat and that&amp;#39;s because the only</text><text start="629.12" dur="4">place place where heat is being removed</text><text start="630.8" dur="4.92">from the system is the sidewalls of the</text><text start="633.12" dur="4.839">tube so you&amp;#39;re filling the tube with</text><text start="635.72" dur="4.919">molten metal and then the molon metal is</text><text start="637.959" dur="4.361">chilling on the walls of the tube and</text><text start="640.639" dur="3.841">actually forming this pipe and the</text><text start="642.32" dur="4.28">reason that it&amp;#39;s so perfectly smooth and</text><text start="644.48" dur="4.56">round is that the temperature on the</text><text start="646.6" dur="4.4">inside is constant the wall thickness of</text><text start="649.04" dur="4.4">the borosilicate tube is constant and</text><text start="651" dur="4.839">the temperature outside is constant all</text><text start="653.44" dur="4.12">of those are set either ambient air or</text><text start="655.839" dur="3.641">set by the temperature of the reaction</text><text start="657.56" dur="3.88">or anything like that which means means</text><text start="659.48" dur="4.12">that the amount of heat that is lost to</text><text start="661.44" dur="4.92">the system is going to be roughly</text><text start="663.6" dur="4.64">uniform in all directions which means</text><text start="666.36" dur="6.12">that when molten iron touches the walls</text><text start="668.24" dur="6.44">it&amp;#39;s losing heat to the outside air and</text><text start="672.48" dur="4.88">solidifying so when that molten iron</text><text start="674.68" dur="4.76">solidifies it has given up its energy</text><text start="677.36" dur="4.4">the energy that was once keeping it a</text><text start="679.44" dur="4.44">liquid has been dispersed into the glass</text><text start="681.76" dur="4.879">tube and into the ambient air around the</text><text start="683.88" dur="4.92">experiment so it is no longer available</text><text start="686.639" dur="4.601">energy to continue the thermite reaction</text><text start="688.8" dur="5.36">continue that propagation now if you</text><text start="691.24" dur="4.76">look at the results of the two different</text><text start="694.16" dur="3.359">experiments one with the thermite that I</text><text start="696" dur="3.279">just sort of poured into the tube and</text><text start="697.519" dur="3.88">one with the thermite that I packed into</text><text start="699.279" dur="4.761">the tube that was denser of course the</text><text start="701.399" dur="4.961">wall thickness of the denser tube is</text><text start="704.04" dur="4.88">more because there was literally more</text><text start="706.36" dur="5.76">iron to precipitate out of the reaction</text><text start="708.92" dur="5.8">which also means that there was more of</text><text start="712.12" dur="5.08">the there was more energy created but</text><text start="714.72" dur="6.2">the there was also more energy lost and</text><text start="717.2" dur="5.48">that thick ring of iron has a very high</text><text start="720.92" dur="3.64">thermal mass and thermal conductivity</text><text start="722.68" dur="6">that it can sap energy away from the</text><text start="724.56" dur="5.8">reaction very quickly so in a infinitely</text><text start="728.68" dur="3.56">large tube you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="730.36" dur="3.599">this problem because it would just grow</text><text start="732.24" dur="4.32">out of the powder and all of the iron</text><text start="733.959" dur="4.361">would remain molten but because it is</text><text start="736.56" dur="4.04">able to give up energy through the</text><text start="738.32" dur="4.639">sidewalls of the tube that becomes the</text><text start="740.6" dur="4.84">dominant factor in the reaction so</text><text start="742.959" dur="4.68">previously I have enjoyed using thermite</text><text start="745.44" dur="3.44">both constructively and destructively</text><text start="747.639" dur="3.281">but this has been the first time I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="748.88" dur="4.36">tried to understand their reaction more</text><text start="750.92" dur="6.12">scientifically so I hope you found it as</text><text start="753.24"
