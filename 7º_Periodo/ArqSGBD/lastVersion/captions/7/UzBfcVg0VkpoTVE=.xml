dur="4.48">functions exponentials and other pure</text><text start="52.48" dur="4.16">functions like that so if you build up</text><text start="54.8" dur="4.439">some fluency with the ideas of rates of</text><text start="56.64" dur="4.64">change for those kinds of pure abstract</text><text start="59.239" dur="3.601">functions it gives you a language to</text><text start="61.28" dur="3.519">more

that</text><text start="73.52" dur="3.599">happens if you get that feeling it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="75.56" dur="3.4">also easy to lose sight of the fact that</text><text start="77.119" dur="3.96">derivatives are fundamentally about just</text><text start="78.96" dur="3.88">looking at tiny changes to some quantity</text><text start="81.079" dur="4.36">and how that relates to a

dur="3.28">show you how you can think about a few</text><text start="88.96" dur="3.6">of these rules in intuitively and</text><text start="90.84" dur="3.76">geometrically and I really want to</text><text start="92.56" dur="4.4">encourage you to never forget that tiny</text><text start="94.6" dur="4.24">nudges are at the heart of</text><text start="96.96" dur="4.88">derivatives let&amp;#39;s start with a simple</text><text start="98.84" dur="5.36">function like f ofx = x^2 what if I</text><text start="101.84" dur="5.52">asked you its derivative that is if you</text><text start="104.2" dur="4.72">were to look at some value X like xal 2</text><text start="107.36" dur="4.24">and compare it to a value slightly</text><text start="108.92" dur="4.44">bigger just DX bigger

for intuition we know</text><text start="125.24" dur="4.2">that you can think of this ratio DF DX</text><text start="127.52" dur="4.96">as the slope of a tangent line to the</text><text start="129.44" dur="5.36">graph of X2 and from that you can see</text><text start="132.48" dur="4.64">that the slope generally increases as X</text><text start="134.8" dur="5.4">increases at zero the tangent line is</text><text start="137.12" dur="4.479">flat and the slope is zero at xal 1 it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="140.2" dur="5">something a bit</text><text start="141.599" dur="5.481">steeper at xal 2 it&amp;#39;s steeper still but</text><text start="145.2" dur="3.679">looking at graphs isn&amp;#39;t generally the</text><text start="147.08" dur="3.64">best way to understand the precise</text><text start="148.879" dur="3.481">formula for a derivative</text><text start="150.72" dur="4.519">for that it&amp;#39;s best to take a more</text><text start="152.36" dur="4.32">literal look at what X2 actually means</text><text start="155.239" dur="3.841">and in this case let&amp;#39;s go ahead and</text><text start="156.68" dur="5.44">picture a square whose side length is</text><text start="159.08" dur="5.36">X if you increase X by some tiny nudge</text><text start="162.12" dur="4.72">some little DX what&amp;#39;s the resulting</text><text start="164.44" dur="4.879">change in the area of that</text><text start="166.84" dur="5.36">square that slight change in area is</text><text start="169.319" dur="5.321">what DF means in this context it&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="172.2" dur="5.399">tiny increase to the value of f ofx =</text><text start="174.64" dur="5.48">x^2 caused by increasing X by that tiny</text><text start="177.599" dur="4.36">nudge DX now you can see see that</text><text start="180.12" dur="4.28">there&amp;#39;s three new bits of area in this</text><text start="181.959" dur="5.321">diagram two Thin rectangles and a</text><text start="184.4" dur="5.52">minuscule Square the two Thin rectangles</text><text start="187.28" dur="6.239">each have side lengths of X and DX so</text><text start="189.92" dur="6.44">they account for 2 * x * DX units of new</text><text start="193.519" dur="4.121">area for example let&amp;#39;s say x was 3 and</text><text start="196.36" dur="4.08">DX was</text><text start="197.64" dur="6.92">0.01 then that new area from these two</text><text start="200.44" dur="4.96">Thin rectangles would be 2 * 3 * 0.01</text><text start="204.56" dur="4.2">which is</text><text start="205.4" dur="5.919">0.06 about 6 times the size of</text><text start="208.76" dur="5.119">DX that little square there has an area</text><text start="211.319" dur="6.441">of dx^ s but you should think of that as</text><text start="213.879" dur="5.64">being really tiny negligibly tiny for</text><text start="217.76" dur="5.039">example if DX was</text><text start="219.519" dur="5.961">0.01 that would be only</text><text start="222.799" dur="4.44">0.00001 and keep in mind I&amp;#39;m drawing DX</text><text start="225.48" dur="4.16">with a fair bit of width here just so we</text><text start="227.239" dur="4.481">can actually see it but always remember</text><text start="229.64" dur="5.519">in principle DX should be thought of as</text><text start="231.72" dur="5.599">a truly tiny amount and for those truly</text><text start="235.159" dur="3.601">tiny amounts A good rule of thumb is</text><text start="237.319" dur="4">that you can ignore anything that</text><text start="238.76" dur="5.72">includes a DX raised to a power greater</text><text start="241.319" dur="5.081">than one that is a tiny change squared</text><text start="244.48" dur="4.2">is a negligible</text><text start="246.4" dur="5.64">change what this leaves us with is that</text><text start="248.68" dur="5.68">DF is just some multiple of DX and that</text><text start="252.04" dur="7.08">multiple 2x which you could also write</text><text start="254.36" dur="7.48">as DF / DX is the derivative of X2 for</text><text start="259.12" dur="5.12">example if you were starting at xal 3</text><text start="261.84" dur="4.72">then as you slightly increase X the rate</text><text start="264.24" dur="6.44">of change in the area per unit change in</text><text start="266.56" dur="7.199">length added dx^ 2 over DX would be 2 *</text><text start="270.68" dur="5.6">3 or 6 and if instead you were starting</text><text start="273.759" dur="6.641">at xal 5 then the rate of change would</text><text start="276.28" dur="6.4">be 10 units of area per unit change in</text><text start="280.4" dur="5.639">X let&amp;#39;s go ahead and try a different</text><text start="282.68" dur="5.04">simple function f ofx = x cubed this is</text><text start="286.039" dur="3.241">going to be the geometric view of the</text><text start="287.72" dur="3.919">stuff that I went through algebraically</text><text start="289.28" dur="4.12">in the last video what&amp;#39;s nice here is</text><text start="291.639" dur="4.041">that we can think of X cubed as the</text><text start="293.4" dur="5.2">volume of an actual Cube whose side</text><text start="295.68" dur="6.44">lengths are X and when you increase X by</text><text start="298.6" dur="6.439">a tiny nudge a DX the resulting increase</text><text start="302.12" dur="5">in volume is what I have here in yellow</text><text start="305.039" dur="4.72">that represents all the volume in a cube</text><text start="307.12" dur="4.48">with side length x plus DX that&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="309.759" dur="4.761">already in the original Cube the one</text><text start="311.6" dur="4.599">with side length x it&amp;#39;s nice to think of</text><text start="314.52" dur="4.239">this new volume as broken up into</text><text start="316.199" dur="5.481">multiple components but almost all of it</text><text start="318.759" dur="5.401">comes from these three square faces or</text><text start="321.68" dur="5">said a little more precisely as DX</text><text start="324.16" dur="4.96">approaches zero those three squares</text><text start="326.68" dur="3.48">comprise a portion closer and closer to</text><text start="329.12" dur="4.079">100%</text><text start="330.16" dur="5.479">of that new yellow</text><text start="333.199" dur="6.521">volume each of those thin squares has a</text><text start="335.639" dur="6.761">volume of x^2 * DX the area of the face</text><text start="339.72" dur="6.479">times that little thickness DX so in</text><text start="342.4" dur="6.16">total this gives us 3x^2 DX of volume</text><text start="346.199" dur="4.72">change and to be sure there are other</text><text start="348.56" dur="4.4">slivers of volume here along the edges</text><text start="350.919" dur="3.361">and that tiny one in the corner but all</text><text start="352.96" dur="4.519">of that volume is going to be</text><text start="354.28" dur="5.759">proportional to dx2 or DX cubed so we</text><text start="357.479" dur="4.041">can safely ignore them again again this</text><text start="360.039" dur="3.041">is ultimately because they&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="361.52" dur="4.64">be divided by</text><text start="363.08" dur="4.88">DX and if there&amp;#39;s still any DX remaining</text><text start="366.16" dur="5.159">then those terms aren&amp;#39;t going to survive</text><text start="367.96" dur="5.079">the process of letting DX approach zero</text><text start="371.319" dur="4.28">what this means is that the derivative</text><text start="373.039" dur="7">of x cubed the rate at which X cubed</text><text start="375.599" dur="6.44">changes per unit change of X is 3 *</text><text start="380.039" dur="4.361">x^2 what that means in terms of</text><text start="382.039" dur="4.801">graphical intuition is that the slope of</text><text start="384.4" dur="7.16">the graph of x cubed at every single</text><text start="386.84" dur="4.72">point x is exactly 3x^2</text><text start="394" dur="3.919">and reasoning about that slope it should</text><text start="395.919" dur="4.601">make sense that this derivative is high</text><text start="397.919" dur="4.28">on the left and then zero at the origin</text><text start="400.52" dur="3.799">and then high again as you move to the</text><text start="402.199" dur="4.161">right but just thinking in terms of the</text><text start="404.319" dur="5.28">graph would never have landed us on the</text><text start="406.36" dur="5.16">precise quantity 3x^2 for that we had to</text><text start="409.599" dur="4">take a much more direct look at what x</text><text start="411.52" dur="4.519">cubed actually</text><text start="413.599" dur="4.16">means now in practice you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="416.039" dur="3.16">necessarily think of the square every</text><text start="417.759" dur="2.321">time you&amp;#39;re taking the derivative of x</text><text start="419.199" dur="2.521">squ</text><text start="420.08" dur="2.799">nor would you necessarily think of this</text><text start="421.72" dur="3.759">Cube whenever you&amp;#39;re taking the</text><text start="422.879" dur="4.44">derivative of x cubed both of them fall</text><text start="425.479" dur="5.361">under a pretty recognizable pattern for</text><text start="427.319" dur="6.32">polinomial terms the derivative of x 4th</text><text start="430.84" dur="6.919">turns out to be 4 x cubed the derivative</text><text start="433.639" dur="6.96">of x 5th is 5 x to 4th and so</text><text start="437.759" dur="6.041">on abstractly you&amp;#39;d write this as the</text><text start="440.599" dur="6">derivative of x to the N for any power n</text><text start="443.8"

one</text><text start="656.44" dur="5.68">so if x was stretched out to two then</text><text start="658.92" dur="5.24">that is forced down to 1/2 and if you</text><text start="662.12"

focus</text><text start="763" dur="4.48">on the sign function so for this section</text><text start="766.12" dur="3.04">I&amp;#39;m going to assume that you&amp;#39;re already</text><text start="767.48" dur="4.159">familiar with how to think about trig</text><text start="769.16" dur="4.96">functions using the unit circle the</text><text start="771.639" dur="5.281">circle with a radius one centered at the</text><text start="774.12" dur="6.12">origin for a given value of theta like</text><text start="776.92" dur="5.64">say 0.8 you imagine walking around the</text><text start="780.24" dur="4.399">circle starting from the rightmost point</text><text start="782.56" dur="5.44">until you&amp;#39;ve traversed that distance of</text><text start="784.639" dur="5.56">0.8 in Arc Length this is the same thing</text><text start="788" dur="4.72">as saying that the angle right here is</text><text start="790.199" dur="6">exactly Theta radians since the circle</text><text start="792.72" dur="6.44">has a radius of one then what s of theta</text><text start="796.199" dur="3.76">means is the height of that point above</text><text start="799.16" dur="3.76">the</text><text start="799.959" dur="4.961">x-axis and as your Theta value increases</text><text start="802.92" dur="5.96">and you walk around this circle your</text><text start="804.92" dur="6.44">height Bobs up and down between -1 and 1</text><text start="808.88" dur="5.199">so so when you graph s of theta versus</text><text start="811.36" dur="5.36">Theta you get this wave pattern the</text><text start="814.079" dur="4.961">quintessential wave</text><text start="816.72" dur="4.359">pattern and just from looking at this</text><text start="819.04" dur="5.08">graph we can start to get a feel for the</text><text start="821.079" dur="5.44">shape of the derivative of the sign the</text><text start="824.12" dur="5.56">slope at zero is something positive</text><text start="826.519" dur="4.921">since s of theta is increasing there and</text><text start="829.68" dur="4.2">as we move to the right and S of theta</text><text start="831.44" dur="5.519">approaches its peak that slope goes down</text><text start="833.88" dur="4.72">to zero then the slope is negative for a</text><text start="836.959" dur="2.721">little while while the sign is</text><text start="838.6" dur="3.039">decreasing</text><text start="839.68" dur="3.76">before coming back up to zero as the</text><text start="841.639" dur="4.161">sign graph levels</text><text start="843.44" dur="4.04">out and as you continue thinking this</text><text start="845.8" dur="3.08">through and drawing it out if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="847.48" dur="3.4">familiar with the graph of trig</text><text start="848.88" dur="4.12">functions you might guess that this</text><text start="850.88" dur="4.44">derivative graph should be exactly</text><text start="853" dur="4.04">cosine of theta since all the Peaks and</text><text start="855.32" dur="3.12">valleys line up perfectly with where the</text><text start="857.04" dur="4.359">Peaks and valleys for the cosine</text><text start="858.44" dur="4.839">function should be and spoiler alert the</text><text start="861.399" dur="4.081">derivative is in fact the cosine of</text><text start="863.279" dur="4.92">theta but aren&amp;#39;t you a little curious</text><text start="865.48" dur="4.4">about why it&amp;#39;s precisely cosine of theta</text><text start="868.199" dur="3.2">I mean you could have sorts of functions</text><text start="869.88" dur="3.639">with Peaks and valleys at the same</text><text start="871.399" dur="3.841">points that have roughly the same shape</text><text start="873.519" dur="3.201">but who knows maybe the derivative of</text><text start="875.24" dur="3.599">sign could have turned out to be some</text><text start="876.72" dur="3.88">entirely new type of function that just</text><text start="878.839" dur="4">happens to have a similar</text><text start="880.6" dur="4.88">shape well just like the previous</text><text start="882.839" dur="4.401">examples a more exact understanding of</text><text start="885.48" dur="3.96">the derivative requires looking at what</text><text start="887.24" dur="4">the function actually represents rather</text><text start="889.44" dur="4">than looking at the graph of the</text><text start="891.24" dur="4.519">function so think back to that walk</text><text start="893.44" dur="4.399">around the unit circle having traversed</text><text start="895.759" dur="4.88">an arc with length Theta and thinking</text><text start="897.839" dur="5.481">about s of theta as the height of that</text><text start="900.639" dur="5.521">point now zoom into that point on the</text><text start="903.32" dur="5.319">circle and consider a slight nudge of D</text><text start="906.16" dur="5.52">Theta along their circumference a tiny</text><text start="908.639" dur="5.241">step in your walk around the unit circle</text><text start="911.68" dur="4.48">how much does that tiny step change the</text><text start="913.88" dur="4.72">sign of theta how much does this</text><text start="916.16" dur="4.44">increased D Theta of Arc Length increase</text><text start="918.6" dur="4.56">the height above the</text><text start="920.6" dur="4.159">x-axis well zoomed in close enough the</text><text start="923.16" dur="3.44">circle basically looks like a straight</text><text start="924.759" dur="3.961">line in this neighborhood so let&amp;#39;s go</text><text start="926.6" dur="3.719">ahead and think of this right triangle</text><text start="928.72" dur="4.119">where the hypotenuse of that right</text><text start="930.319" dur="4.801">triangle represents the nudge D Theta</text><text start="932.839" dur="4.201">along the circumference and that left</text><text start="935.12" dur="5.04">side here represents the change in</text><text start="937.04" dur="5.2">height the resulting D sin of theta now</text><text start="940.16" dur="4.32">this tiny triangle is actually similar</text><text start="942.24" dur="4.159">to this larger triangle here with the</text><text start="944.48" dur="4.039">defining angle Theta and whose</text><text start="946.399" dur="3.521">hypotenuse is the radius of the circle</text><text start="948.519" dur="4.56">with length</text><text start="949.92" dur="6.399">one specifically this little angle right</text><text start="953.079" dur="5.281">here is precisely equal to Theta</text><text start="956.319" dur="4.96">radians now think about what the</text><text start="958.36" dur="5.2">derivative of sign is supposed to mean</text><text start="961.279" dur="4.36">it&amp;#39;s the ratio between that D sin of</text><text start="963.56" dur="4.68">theta the tiny change to the height</text><text start="965.639" dur="3.801">divid D Theta the tiny change to the</text><text start="968.24" dur="3.64">input of the</text><text start="969.44" dur="4.24">function and from the picture we can see</text><text start="971.88" dur="4.68">that that&amp;#39;s the ratio between the length</text><text start="973.68" dur="5.8">of the side adjacent to the angle Theta</text><text start="976.56" dur="5.56">divided by the hypotenuse well let&amp;#39;s see</text><text start="979.48" dur="4.76">adjacent divided by hypotenuse that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="982.12" dur="4.36">exactly what the cosine of theta means</text><text start="984.24" dur="4.719">that&amp;#39;s the definition of the</text><text start="986.48" dur="3.96">cosine so this gives us two different</text><text start="988.959" dur="4.36">really nice ways of thinking about how</text><text start="990.44" dur="4.399">the derivative of s is cosine one of</text><text start="993.319" dur="3.281">them is looking at the graph and getting</text><text start="994.839" dur="3.641">a loose feel for the shape of things</text><text start="996.6" dur="4.719">based on thinking about the slope of the</text><text start="998.48" dur="4.359">sign graph at every single point

dur="4">itself for those of you that like to</text><text start="1008" dur="3.759">pause and Ponder see if you can try a</text><text start="1009.959" dur="3.721">similar line of reasoning to find
