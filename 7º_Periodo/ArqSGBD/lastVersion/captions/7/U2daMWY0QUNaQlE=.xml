dur="4.86">below the water yes really so back to</text><text start="322.25" dur="3.84">Ellis Island for a moment which 150</text><text start="324.68" dur="3.63">years after borders were

dur="4.56">Jersey said was hers New York disagreed</text><text start="345.98" dur="4.62">saying the in bigand island was still</text><text start="348.17" dur="4.11">her Island now how did Ellis Island it</text><text start="350.6" dur="3.3">get bigger well New York claimed while</text><text start="352.28" dur="4.41">digging up the subways she dumped the</text><text start="353.9" dur="5.4">dirt here in New Jersey&amp;#39;s half of the</text><text start="356.69" dur="4.41">river but her dirt her new land which is</text><text start="359.3" dur="3.99">an interesting territorial

dur="5.19">court to prove where the land came from</text><text start="367.76" dur="4.35">so how Ellis Island grew three sizes is</text><text start="370.49" dur="3.3">just lost to history</text><text start="372.11" dur="3.42">but whatever the court ruled everything</text><text start="373.79" dur="3.42">above the water was New York and</text><text start="375.53" dur="4.23">everything below the water was New</text><text start="377.21" dur="5.25">Jersey but if below became above new New</text><text start="379.76" dur="4.8">Jersey it would be and thus this island</text><text start="382.46" dur="4.26">belongs to New Jersey with just this</text><text start="384.56" dur="4.83">little original part being New York</text><text start="386.72" dur="4.92">which is a sublime and ridiculous
