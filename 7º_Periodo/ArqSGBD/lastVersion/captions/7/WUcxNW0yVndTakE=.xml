dur="4.559">derivatives of simple functions and the</text><text start="19.4" dur="4.199">goal was to have a clear picture or</text><text start="21.439" dur="3.92">intuition to hold in your mind that</text><text start="23.599" dur="4.201">actually explains where these formulas</text><text start="25.359" dur="3.961">come from but of course most of the</text><text start="27.8" dur="3.44">functions you deal with in modeling the</text><text start="29.32" dur="3.399">world involve somehow mixing or</text><text start="31.24" dur="3.839">combining or tweaking these simple</text><text start="32.719" dur="4.561">functions in some other way so our</text><text start="35.079" dur="5.16">natural next step is to understand how</text><text start="37.28" dur="4.959">you take derivatives of more complicated</text><text start="40.239" dur="3.561">combinations and again I don&amp;#39;t want</text><text start="42.239" dur="3.561">these to be something to memorize I want</text><text start="43.8" dur="5.04">you to have a clear picture in mind for</text><text start="45.8" dur="3.04">where each one comes</text><text start="48.879" dur="5.16">from now this really boils down into</text><text start="51.6" dur="3.92">three basic ways to combine functions</text><text start="54.039" dur="3.441">you can add them together you can</text><text start="55.52" dur="4.96">multiply them and you can throw one</text><text start="57.48" dur="5.48">inside the other known as composing them</text><text start="60.48" dur="4.039">sure you could say subtracting them but</text><text start="62.96" dur="5.199">really that&amp;#39;s just multiplying the</text><text start="64.519" dur="5.561">second by ne1 and adding them together</text><text start="68.159" dur="3.32">and likewise dividing functions doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="70.08" dur="3.92">really add anything because that&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="71.479" dur="5.081">same as plugging one inside the function</text><text start="74" dur="4.88">1 /x and then multiplying the two</text><text start="76.56" dur="4.239">together so really most functions you</text><text start="78.88" dur="3.599">come across just involve layering</text><text start="80.799" dur="3.481">together these three different types of</text><text start="82.479" dur="3.6">combinations though there&amp;#39;s not really</text><text start="84.28" dur="3.879">abound on how monstrous things can</text><text start="86.079" dur="4.04">become but as long as you know how</text><text start="88.159" dur="3.92">derivatives play with just those three</text><text start="90.119" dur="4.161">combination types you&amp;#39;ll always be able</text><text start="92.079" dur="3.641">to just take it step by step and peel</text><text start="94.28" dur="3.76">through the layers for any kind of</text><text start="95.72" dur="5.079">monstrous</text><text start="98.04" dur="4.92">expression so the question is if you</text><text start="100.799" dur="4.401">know the derivative of two functions</text><text start="102.96" dur="3.96">what is the derivative of their sum of</text><text start="105.2" dur="4.199">their product and of the function</text><text start="106.92" dur="5.76">composition between</text><text start="109.399" dur="5.521">them the sum rule is easiest if somewhat</text><text start="112.68" dur="4.64">tongue twisting to say out loud the</text><text start="114.92" dur="3.76">derivative of a sum of two functions is</text><text start="117.32" dur="3.759">the sum of their</text><text start="118.68" dur="4.759">derivatives but it&amp;#39;s worth warming up</text><text start="121.079" dur="3.921">with this example by really thinking</text><text start="123.439" dur="4.32">through what it means to take a</text><text start="125" dur="4.239">derivative of a sum of two functions</text><text start="127.759" dur="3.84">since the derivative patterns for</text><text start="129.239" dur="4.481">products and for function composition</text><text start="131.599" dur="3.961">won&amp;#39;t be so straightforward and they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="133.72" dur="4.12">going to require this kind of deeper</text><text start="135.56" dur="6.52">thinking for example let&amp;#39;s think about</text><text start="137.84" dur="6.119">this function f ofx = sin of x + x^2</text><text start="142.08" dur="4.159">it&amp;#39;s a function where for every input</text><text start="143.959" dur="6.041">you add together the values of sin of X</text><text start="146.239" dur="6.441">and X2 at that point</text><text start="150" dur="5.36">for example let&amp;#39;s say at x equals</text><text start="152.68" dur="4.48">0.5 the height of the sign graph is</text><text start="155.36" dur="4.879">given by this vertical</text><text start="157.16" dur="4.64">bar and the height of the X squ Parabola</text><text start="160.239" dur="2.961">is given by this slightly smaller</text><text start="161.8" dur="4">vertical</text><text start="163.2" dur="5.6">bar and their sum is the length you get</text><text start="165.8" dur="4.84">by just stacking them together now for</text><text start="168.8" dur="4.359">the derivative you want to ask what</text><text start="170.64" dur="5.92">happens as you nudge that input slightly</text><text start="173.159" dur="6.36">maybe increasing it up to 0.5 plus</text><text start="176.56" dur="5.24">DX the difference in the value of f</text><text start="179.519" dur="3.841">between between those two places is what</text><text start="181.8" dur="4.24">we call</text><text start="183.36" dur="4.64">DF and when you picture it like this I</text><text start="186.04" dur="4.24">think you&amp;#39;ll agree that the total change</text><text start="188" dur="5.2">in the height is whatever the change to</text><text start="190.28" dur="6.679">the sign graph is what we might call D</text><text start="193.2" dur="6.399">sin of X plus whatever the change to x^2</text><text start="196.959" dur="2.64">is</text><text start="201.72" dur="6.159">dx2 now we know that the derivative of s</text><text start="205.08" dur="5.799">is cosine and remember what that means</text><text start="207.879" dur="7.121">it means that this little change d X is</text><text start="210.879" dur="7.121">about cosine of x * DX it&amp;#39;s proportional</text><text start="215" dur="4.799">to the size of our initial nudge DX and</text><text start="218" dur="4.28">the proportionality constant equals</text><text start="219.799" dur="5.761">cosine of whatever input we happen to</text><text start="222.28" dur="6.64">start at likewise because the derivative</text><text start="225.56" dur="6.599">of x^2 is 2x the change in the height of</text><text start="228.92" dur="5.72">the x^2 graph is going to be about 2 * x</text><text start="232.159" dur="7.961">* whatever DX</text><text start="234.64" dur="7.72">was so rearranging DF / DX the ratio of</text><text start="240.12" dur="5.08">the tiny change to this sum function to</text><text start="242.36" dur="6.32">the tiny change in X that caused it is</text><text start="245.2" dur="5.319">indeed cosine of x + 2x the sum of the</text><text start="248.68" dur="4.72">derivatives of its</text><text start="250.519" dur="5.121">parts but like I said things are a bit</text><text start="253.4" dur="4.04">different for products and let&amp;#39;s think</text><text start="255.64" dur="4.68">through why and let&amp;#39;s think through why</text><text start="257.44" dur="4.4">in terms of tiny nudges again in this</text><text start="260.32" dur="3.68">case I don&amp;#39;t think graphs are our best</text><text start="261.84" dur="4.32">bet for visualizing things pretty</text><text start="264" dur="4.32">commonly in math at a lot of levels of</text><text start="266.16" dur="4.599">math really if you&amp;#39;re dealing with a</text><text start="268.32" dur="4.84">product of two things it helps to</text><text start="270.759" dur="3.801">understand it as some kind of area in</text><text start="273.16" dur="3.52">this case maybe you try to configure</text><text start="274.56" dur="4.44">some mental setup of a box where the</text><text start="276.68" dur="4.68">side lengths are sign of X and</text><text start="279" dur="5.44">x^2 but what would that</text><text start="281.36" dur="5.24">mean well since these are functions you</text><text start="284.44" dur="4.96">might think of those sides as adjustable</text><text start="286.6" dur="4.319">dependent on the value of x which maybe</text><text start="289.4" dur="4.639">you think of as this number that you can</text><text start="290.919" dur="5.201">just freely adjust up and down so</text><text start="294.039" dur="4.521">getting a feel for what this means focus</text><text start="296.12" dur="5.56">on that top side there who changes as</text><text start="298.56" dur="6">the function sign of X as you change</text><text start="301.68" dur="5.44">this value of x up from zero it</text><text start="304.56" dur="5.56">increases up to a length of one as s of</text><text start="307.12" dur="5.519">X moves up towards its peak and after</text><text start="310.12" dur="6">that it starts to decrease as s of X</text><text start="312.639" dur="6.361">comes down from one and in the same way</text><text start="316.12" dur="6.28">that height there is always changing as</text><text start="319" dur="5.44">X2 so F ofx defined as the product of</text><text start="322.4" dur="3.639">these two functions is going to be the</text><text start="324.44" dur="4.28">area of this</text><text start="326.039" dur="5.921">box and for the derivative let&amp;#39;s think</text><text start="328.72" dur="5.84">about how a tiny change to X by DX</text><text start="331.96" dur="6.2">influences that area what is that</text><text start="334.56" dur="3.6">resulting change in area</text><text start="338.44" dur="6.599">DF well the nudge DX caused that width</text><text start="342.039" dur="6.88">to change by some small D sin of X and</text><text start="345.039" dur="3.88">it caused that height to change by su</text><text start="349.68" dur="5">dx2 and this gives us three little</text><text start="351.96" dur="5.32">Snippets of new area a thin rectangle on</text><text start="354.68" dur="6.04">the bottom whose area is its width s of</text><text start="357.28" dur="5.68">x times its thin height d</text><text start="360.72" dur="5.68">x^2 and there&amp;#39;s this thin rectangle on</text><text start="362.96" dur="6.799">the right whose area is its height x^2</text><text start="366.4" dur="5.48">time its thin little width D sin of</text><text start="369.759" dur="4.84">X and there&amp;#39;s also this little bit in</text><text start="371.88" dur="4.4">the corner but we can ignore that its</text><text start="374.599" dur="4.761">area is ultimately going to be</text><text start="376.28" dur="5.44">proportional to dx^ 2 and as we&amp;#39;ve seen</text><text start="379.36" dur="3.559">before that becomes negligible as DX</text><text start="381.72" dur="3.8">goes to</text><text start="382.919" dur="4.521">zero I mean this whole setup is very</text><text start="385.52" dur="5.119">similar to what I showed last video with</text><text start="387.44" dur="5.08">the x s diagram and just like then keep</text><text start="390.639" dur="4">in mind that I&amp;#39;m using somewhat beefy</text><text start="392.52" dur="4.04">changes here to draw things just so that</text><text start="394.639" dur="4.4">we can actually see them but in</text><text start="396.56" dur="5.56">principle DX is something very very</text><text start="399.039" dur="6.321">small and that means that dx^ 2 and D</text><text start="402.12" dur="5.919">sin of X are also very very</text><text start="405.36" dur="5.559">small so applying what we know about the</text><text start="408.039" dur="7.201">derivative of s and of x^2 that tiny</text><text start="410.919" dur="7.801">change dx^ 2 is going to be about 2x *</text><text start="415.24" dur="6.679">DX and that tiny change D sin of X well</text><text start="418.72" dur="7.159">that&amp;#39;s going to be about cosine of x *</text><text start="421.919" dur="8.28">DX as usual we divide out by that DX to</text><text start="425.879" dur="7.481">see that the ratio we want DF / DX is</text><text start="430.199" dur="6.72">sin of x * the derivative of x^2 plus</text><text start="433.36" dur="5.959">x^2 * the derivative of</text><text start="436.919" dur="5.321">s and nothing we&amp;#39;ve done here is</text><text start="439.319" dur="4.6">specific to s or to x^2 this same line</text><text start="442.24" dur="3.639">of reasoning would work for any two</text><text start="443.919" dur="4.481">functions G and</text><text start="445.879" dur="4.281">H and sometimes people like to remember</text><text start="448.4" dur="3.919">this pattern with a certain pneumonic</text><text start="450.16" dur="5.2">that you kind of sing in your head left</text><text start="452.319" dur="6.121">d right right d left in this example</text><text start="455.36" dur="5.119">where we have sin of x * x^2 left d</text><text start="458.44" dur="5.039">right means you take that left function</text><text start="460.479" dur="6.241">s of x times the derivative of the right</text><text start="463.479" dur="6.84">in this case 2x then you add on right d</text><text start="466.72" dur="6.56">left that right function x^2 times the</text><text start="470.319" dur="6.241">derivative of the left one cosine of</text><text start="473.28" dur="5.52">x now out of context presented as a rule</text><text start="476.56" dur="4.759">to remember I think this would feel</text><text start="478.8" dur="4.64">pretty strange don&amp;#39;t you but when you</text><text start="481.319" dur="4.121">actually think of this adjustable box</text><text start="483.44" dur="4.719">you can see what each of those terms</text><text start="485.44" dur="5.4">represents Lefty right is the area of</text><text start="488.159" dur="2.681">that little bottom</text><text start="491.08" dur="5.92">rectangle and right d left is the area</text><text start="493.759" dur="3.241">of that rectangle on the</text><text start="499.199" dur="5.4">side by the way I should mention that if</text><text start="501.479" dur="5.961">you multiply by a constant say 2 * sin</text><text start="504.599" dur="4.361">of X things end up a lot simpler the</text><text start="507.44" dur="3.64">derivative is just the same as the</text><text start="508.96" dur="5.48">constant multiplied by the derivative of</text><text start="511.08" dur="6.079">the function in this case 2 * cosine of</text><text start="514.44" dur="4.599">x I&amp;#39;ll leave it to you to pause and</text><text start="517.159" dur="4">Ponder and just kind of verify that that</text><text start="519.039" dur="4.36">makes</text><text start="521.159" dur="4.201">sense aside from addition and</text><text start="523.399" dur="3.801">multiplication the other common way to</text><text start="525.36" dur="4.44">combine functions and believe me this</text><text start="527.2" dur="4.88">one comes up all the time is to shove</text><text start="529.8" dur="4.44">one inside the other function</text><text start="532.08" dur="4.6">composition for example maybe we take</text><text start="534.24" dur="5.24">the function x^2 and we just shove it on</text><text start="536.68" dur="3.8">inside sin of x to get this new function</text><text start="539.48" dur="3.359">sin of</text><text start="540.48" dur="3.919">x^2 what do you think the derivative of</text><text start="542.839" dur="3.761">that new function</text><text start="544.399" dur="4.241">is to think this one through I&amp;#39;m going</text><text start="546.6" dur="3.88">to choose yet another way to visualize</text><text start="548.64" dur="4.639">things just to emphasize that in</text><text start="550.48" dur="5.16">Creative math we&amp;#39;ve got lots of options</text><text start="553.279" dur="4.161">I&amp;#39;ll put up three different number lines</text><text start="555.64" dur="4.6">the top one is going to hold the value</text><text start="557.44" dur="5.639">of x the second one is going to hold the</text><text start="560.24" dur="5.159">value of x squ and that third line is</text><text start="563.079" dur="5.161">going to hold the value of s of</text><text start="565.399" dur="5.401">x^2 that is the function x^2 gets you</text><text start="568.24" dur="5.56">from Line 1 to line 2 and the function</text><text start="570.8" dur="6.24">sign gets you from line two to line</text><text start="573.8" dur="5.32">3 as I shift around this value of x</text><text start="577.04" dur="5.08">maybe moving it up to the value</text><text start="579.12" dur="5.959">three that second value stays pegged to</text><text start="582.12" dur="7.04">whatever X2 is in this case moving up to</text><text start="585.079" dur="6.681">9 and that bottom value being s of x^2</text><text start="589.16" dur="5.08">is going to go to whatever s of 9</text><text start="591.76" dur="5.6">happens to</text><text start="594.24" dur="5.24">be so for the derivative let&amp;#39;s again</text><text start="597.36" dur="5.039">start by just nudging that x value by</text><text start="599.48" dur="4.4">some little DX and I always think that</text><text start="602.399" dur="4.721">it&amp;#39;s helpful to think of X as starting</text><text start="603.88" dur="6.32">at some actual concrete number maybe 1.5</text><text start="607.12" dur="6.04">in this case the resulting nudge to that</text><text start="610.2" dur="5.759">second value the change in X2 caused by</text><text start="613.16" dur="5.6">such a DX is DX</text><text start="615.959" dur="6.521">s and we could expand this like we have</text><text start="618.76" dur="7.92">before as 2x * DX which for our specific</text><text start="622.48" dur="5.799">input would be 2 * 1.5 * DX but it</text><text start="626.68" dur="5.279">actually helps to keep things written as</text><text start="628.279" dur="5.361">dx^ 2 at least for now and in fact I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="631.959" dur="5.44">going to go one step further I&amp;#39;m going</text><text start="633.64" dur="5.759">to give a new name to this x squ maybe H</text><text start="637.399" dur="4.12">so that instead of writing dx^ s for</text><text start="639.399" dur="4.361">this nudge we write</text><text start="641.519" dur="4.32">DH and this makes it easier to think</text><text start="643.76" dur="6.16">about that third value which is now</text><text start="645.839" dur="8">pegged at s of H its change is D sin of</text><text start="649.92" dur="6.359">H the tiny change caused by the nudge</text><text start="653.839" dur="4.921">DH and by the way the fact that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="656.279" dur="4.761">moving to the left while the DH bump is</text><text start="658.76" dur="4.879">going to the right that just means that</text><text start="661.04" dur="5.64">this change D sign of H is going to be</text><text start="663.639" dur="4.801">some kind of negative number and once</text><text start="666.68" dur="5.04">again we can use our knowledge of the</text><text start="668.44" dur="6.72">derivative of the sign this D sin of H</text><text start="671.72" dur="5.04">is going to be about cosine of H * DH</text><text start="675.16" dur="3.04">that&amp;#39;s what it means for the derivative</text><text start="676.76" dur="3.96">of s to be</text><text start="678.2" dur="5.4">cosine and unfolding things we can just</text><text start="680.72" dur="4.6">replace that H with x^2 again so we know</text><text start="683.6" dur="7.32">that that bottom nudge is going to have</text><text start="685.32" dur="7.56">a size of cosine of x^2 * DX s and in</text><text start="690.92" dur="4.719">fact let&amp;#39;s unfold things even further</text><text start="692.88" dur="5.56">that intermediate nudge dx^ 2 is going</text><text start="695.639" dur="5">to be about 2x *</text><text start="698.44" dur="3.959">DX and it&amp;#39;s always a good habit to</text><text start="700.639" dur="4.241">remind yourself of what an expression</text><text start="702.399" dur="6.601">like this actually means in this
