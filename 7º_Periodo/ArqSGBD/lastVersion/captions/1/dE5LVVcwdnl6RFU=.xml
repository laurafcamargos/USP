dur="6">cosmologist was very important for me</text><text start="35.84" dur="6.64">i was very little four years old</text><text start="39.04" dur="5.6">one pop of a question came to me</text><text start="42.48" dur="6.559">and the question that remains on today</text><text start="44.64" dur="4.399">was what is the age of the universe</text><text start="50" dur="5.84">at that moment i started to think what</text><text start="53.36" dur="5.839">kind of science i can study in order to</text><text start="55.84" dur="5.519">answer this question</text><text start="59.199" dur="4.321">ancestor relativity have</text><text start="61.359" dur="4.961">many many problems it&amp;#39;s a beautiful</text><text start="63.52" dur="5.12">theory mathematical theory the problem</text><text start="66.32" dur="4.88">is that are forces that are living in</text><text start="68.64" dur="5.12">different levels of energy gravity is</text><text start="71.2" dur="3.919">very small electromagnet is very strong</text><text start="73.76" dur="3.359">so when he tried to make this</text><text start="75.119" dur="4.121">unification he didn&amp;#39;t get it</text><text start="77.119" dur="9.521">it was impossible mathematically</text><text start="79.24" dur="9.8">[Music]</text><text start="86.64" dur="4.88">he needed to add something by hand</text><text start="89.04" dur="4.96">this something is the cosmological</text><text start="91.52" dur="4.32">constant and he added by hand in order</text><text start="94" dur="3.759">to have this universe evolving and</text><text start="95.84" dur="4.4">evolving evolving and have this</text><text start="97.759" dur="4">expansion of itself but what was the</text><text start="100.24" dur="3.6">problem the problem is that this</text><text start="101.759" dur="4.801">cosmological constant cannot be related</text><text start="103.84" dur="5.84">with a quantum world with a small world</text><text start="106.56" dur="5.839">so the cosmologists assume that there is</text><text start="109.68" dur="5.28">something extreme in universe so this is</text><text start="112.399" dur="5.921">what we call dark energy</text><text start="114.96" dur="5.6">that energy is the simple explanation of</text><text start="118.32" dur="4.32">the expansion of the universe and if we</text><text start="120.56" dur="3.36">link this with the age of the universe</text><text start="122.64" dur="3.6">we will have</text><text start="123.92" dur="5.72">a massive answer to what is happening at</text><text start="126.24" dur="3.4">the very beginning</text><text start="136" dur="5.44">precision cosmology now is the hot</text><text start="138.239" dur="7.441">science i must say why because now we</text><text start="141.44" dur="4.24">are leaving the data analysis era</text><text start="146.239" dur="4.321">if you want to do precision cosmology</text><text start="148.16" dur="4.96">you need the machine learning techniques</text><text start="150.56" dur="5.36">you need computers so machine learning</text><text start="153.12" dur="5.28">can process data of different kinds at</text><text start="155.92" dur="4.72">different velocity and from every corner</text><text start="158.4" dur="4.4">of the universe</text><text start="160.64" dur="5.44">with precision cosmology we try to</text><text start="162.8" dur="5.28">explain alternative theory of gravity</text><text start="166.08" dur="4.08">we are looking for a theory that</text><text start="168.08" dur="4.159">naturally can give you this is that</text><text

simple</text><text start="180" dur="5.92">object that now we got a photograph of</text><text start="182.239" dur="5.521">this organ the famous black hole</text><text start="185.92" dur="3.76">with this second photograph of the even</text><text start="187.76" dur="4.559">horizon telescope now we have the very</text><text start="189.68" dur="5.44">proof that our magnetic fields surround</text><text start="192.319" dur="4.881">these big monsters so the next step is</text><text start="195.12" dur="4.399">to try to understand which kind of</text><text start="197.2" dur="4.6">theory of gravity that can make this</text><text start="199.519" dur="4.8">unification between gravity and</text><text start="201.8" dur="4.519">electromagnetism and also can describe</text><text start="204.319" dur="3.92">these black holes so that was the first</text><text start="206.319" dur="3.761">thing that i wanted to know if there is</text><text start="208.239" dur="3.571">another kind of theory that can do the</text><text start="210.08" dur="7.079">same as einstein</text><text start="211.81" dur="5.349">[Music]</text><text start="218.959" dur="5.2">so

time</text><text start="227.599" dur="5.521">we need another word a very a kind of</text><text start="230" dur="5.599">funny word a torsion so it&amp;#39;s like having</text><text start="233.12" dur="5.199">tornadoes in in every part of the</text><text start="235.599" dur="4.56">universe so intel parallel with these</text><text start="238.319" dur="3.84">little tornadoes with these little</text><text start="240.159" dur="4.401">torsions living in different places of</text><text start="242.159" dur="4.321">the universe we can explain for example</text><text start="244.56" dur="4.08">that energy einstein&amp;#39;s theory of</text><text start="246.48" dur="4.72">regulatory cannot do this</text><text start="248.64" dur="5.44">teleparallel gravity is like a theory</text><text start="251.2" dur="5.599">that complements a general relativity</text><text start="254.08" dur="5.36">when you go closer to the to the big</text><text start="256.799"

can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="264.4" dur="4">explain this</text><text start="265.759" dur="5.041">so maybe this tornadoes these twist</text><text start="268.4" dur="5.92">things in the universe can
