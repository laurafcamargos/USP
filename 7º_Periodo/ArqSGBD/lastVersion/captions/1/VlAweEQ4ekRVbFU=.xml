start="42.059" dur="4.5">into the field and really Empower our</text><text start="44.82" dur="5.52">researchers around the world to be able</text><text start="46.559" dur="6.961">to do diagnostic testing on the spot</text><text start="50.34" dur="5.1">my career trajectory has taken a very</text><text start="53.52" dur="4.26">circuitous path because I was really</text><text start="55.44" dur="4.439">interested in studying disease and</text><text start="57.78" dur="3.36">mechanisms of disease in particular at</text><text start="59.879" dur="4.261">the time I really thought I was going to</text><text start="61.14" dur="6.6">go into cancer research on the side I</text><text start="64.14" dur="6.6">started studying amphibians and this was</text><text start="67.74" dur="5.1">because I had met Anton Simon he&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="70.74" dur="5.04">climate scientist who&amp;#39;s now my husband</text><text start="72.84" dur="5.459">and he was leading Expeditions down to</text><text start="75.78" dur="5.58">Peru to understand how climate change is</text><text start="78.299" dur="4.981">impacting high mountain environments and</text><text start="81.36" dur="4.079">so on one of their expeditions they were</text><text start="83.28" dur="4.74">speaking to the local communities the</text><text start="85.439" dur="5.04">quechua communities who informed them</text><text start="88.02" dur="4.919">that they&amp;#39;d been seeing a lot of frog</text><text start="90.479" dur="4.561">die-offs Anton knew I worked in a</text><text start="92.939" dur="4.201">experimental pathology program and</text><text start="95.04" dur="4.439">reached out to me and so that&amp;#39;s how I</text><text start="97.14" dur="4.799">came aboard the project</text><text start="99.479" dur="4.381">I love high mountain environments this</text><text start="101.939" dur="5.341">is an area that I&amp;#39;ve invested research</text><text start="103.86" dur="6.96">in over two decades now we&amp;#39;ve been doing</text><text start="107.28" dur="5.94">continuous monitoring of amphibians up</text><text start="110.82" dur="4.74">in the the upper reaches of the Andean</text><text start="113.22" dur="4.399">ecosystem this is probably the highest</text><text start="115.56" dur="5.879">herpetological site</text><text start="117.619" dur="5.5">up here it&amp;#39;s at 17 000 feet</text><text start="121.439" dur="4.441">um what we&amp;#39;re collecting is pleuredema</text><text start="123.119" dur="4.86">marmaratum amphibians they&amp;#39;re basically</text><text start="125.88" dur="4.019">indicator species that tell us a lot</text><text start="127.979" dur="4.581">about how the environment is changing</text><text start="129.899" dur="6.301">what we&amp;#39;re doing is swabbing these frogs</text><text start="132.56" dur="6.72">to test for amphibian kitchen fungus</text><text start="136.2" dur="3.08">first found amphibian</text><text start="139.86" dur="4.44">so as the Glaciers are receding you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="142.68" dur="3.6">getting new ponds that are forming</text><text start="144.3" dur="4.38">higher and higher up when these new</text><text start="146.28" dur="5.22">ponds form that creates the environment</text><text start="148.68" dur="4.919">to where pollens get deposited up there</text><text start="151.5" dur="4.5">and microbes and that starts building</text><text start="153.599" dur="4.801">the soils and then those soils can start</text><text start="156" dur="4.5">allowing the growth of plants which then</text><text start="158.4" dur="5.339">bring up insects and so the whole</text><text start="160.5" dur="6.78">biosphere is actually rising in response</text><text start="163.739" dur="7.14">to the rising global temperatures</text><text start="167.28" dur="5.22">we also have a research part of the lab</text><text start="170.879" dur="3.961">where we take on projects with</text><text start="172.5" dur="4.379">collaborators some of that diagnostic</text><text start="174.84" dur="4.8">support has been through developing</text><text start="176.879" dur="5.341">e-dna tests Edna stands for</text><text start="179.64" dur="4.739">environmental DNA and it is DNA that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="182.22" dur="4.08">Shed from organisms that exist in an</text><text start="184.379" dur="3.781">environment it&amp;#39;s DNA that can be</text><text start="186.3" dur="4.62">captured through for example water</text><text start="188.16" dur="6.18">samples soil samples and even air</text><text start="190.92" dur="5.76">samples and it&amp;#39;s a powerful tool that</text><text start="194.34" dur="4.319">allows conservationists to search for</text><text start="196.68" dur="4.44">rare and threatened species look for</text><text start="198.659" dur="4.8">evidence of specific species you can use</text><text start="201.12" dur="4.32">it to perform biodiversity assessments</text><text start="203.459" dur="3.541">to look at all the organisms in the</text><text start="205.44" dur="4.62">environment</text><text start="207" dur="5.22">our first uh area where we&amp;#39;ve opened the</text><text start="210.06" dur="3.78">door to Edna analysis for biodiversity</text><text start="212.22" dur="4.26">assessment was actually done on Mount</text><text start="213.84" dur="4.819">Everest in 2019. so the Expedition</text><text start="216.48" dur="4.679">actually was very interdisciplinary</text><text start="218.659" dur="4.841">pulled scientists from all all over the</text><text start="221.159" dur="5.22">world and so they needed some biologists</text><text start="223.5" dur="4.56">so our idea was to do basically collect</text><text start="226.379" dur="4.92">water samples along an elevational</text><text start="228.06" dur="5.16">gradient up to the highest ponds when we</text><text start="231.299" dur="5.341">were camping on on the glacier at</text><text start="233.22" dur="5.28">Everest Base Camp we were sleeping on a</text><text start="236.64" dur="4.019">moving glacier</text><text start="238.5" dur="3.9">and the sound of the crackling of the</text><text start="240.659" dur="3.421">glacier beneath your tent is you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="242.4" dur="5.16">you&amp;#39;re falling asleep in the thunderous</text><text start="244.08" dur="7.68">Roars of The Avalanches coming down it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="247.56" dur="6.74">both um scary but at the same time it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="251.76" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s just amazing to hear it</text><text start="254.3" dur="3.64">[Music]</text><text start="255.48" dur="5.28">from these 10 sites that we identified</text><text start="257.94" dur="5.52">we collected to over 20 liters of water</text><text start="260.76" dur="3.98">when we brought that back to the lab we</text><text start="263.46" dur="3.78">performed</text><text start="264.74" dur="4.3">analysis of the the Edna that we</text><text start="267.24" dur="3.66">captured from the filters from those 20</text><text start="269.04" dur="4.56">liters of water</text><text start="270.9" dur="4.14">and we performed whole genome shotgun</text><text start="273.6" dur="4.56">sequencing so we sequenced everything</text><text start="275.04" dur="5.82">but we also performed DNA meta barcoding</text><text start="278.16" dur="4.56">where we targeted what you call a DNA</text><text start="280.86" dur="3.779">barcoding Gene</text><text start="282.72" dur="4.74">um which is a mitochondrial DNA Target</text><text start="284.639" dur="5.581">to then identify organisms often down to</text><text start="287.46" dur="4.519">the species level out of this analysis</text><text start="290.22" dur="6.24">we identified</text><text start="291.979" dur="6.821">187 taxonomic orders from 36 phylum</text><text start="296.46" dur="4.019">which is quite impressive it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="298.8" dur="3.839">across the entire tree of life so we</text><text start="300.479" dur="5.641">identified everything from a few viruses</text><text start="302.639" dur="5.941">bacteria fungi plants animals</text><text start="306.12" dur="4.56">when you put into context the number of</text><text start="308.58" dur="5.04">taxonomic orders that we recovered from</text><text start="310.68" dur="5.94">these 20 liters of water when we compare</text><text start="313.62" dur="5.76">them to Total known taxonomic orders of</text><text start="316.62" dur="5.28">around the world we discovered basically</text><text start="319.38" dur="5.94">one-sixth of global taxonomic orders</text><text start="321.9" dur="5.639">just on this one mountain above 4 500</text><text start="325.32" dur="4.68">meters which is is quite remarkable</text><text start="327.539" dur="5.761">especially when you think about areas</text><text start="330" dur="4.979">around the Earth above 4500 meters</text><text start="333.3" dur="4.32">occupies only about three percent of</text><text start="334.979" dur="7.5">land mass it was quite striking that we</text><text start="337.62" dur="8.06">found that that level of diversity up on</text><text start="342.479" dur="5.821">the high slopes of Everest</text><text start="345.68" dur="4.799">I mean we are really pushing the</text><text start="348.3" dur="5.22">boundaries with trying to detect Edna</text><text
