useful</text><text start="24.72" dur="2.959">thing to know in its own right but</text><text start="26.359" dur="3.08">what&amp;#39;s really neat is that it can give</text><text start="27.679" dur="3.84">us a completely different perspective</text><text start="29.439" dur="4.921">for why integrals and derivatives are</text><text start="31.519" dur="5.681">inverses of each other to start take a</text><text start="34.36" dur="6.12">look at the graph of sin of X between 0</text><text start="37.2" dur="5.92">and Pi which is half of its period what</text><text start="40.48" dur="5.2">is the average height of this graph on</text><text start="43.12" dur="4.919">that interval it&amp;#39;s not a useless</text><text start="45.68" dur="4.32">question all sorts of cyclic

the sun is up per day as a function</text><text start="55.079" dur="4.32">of what day of the year it is follows a</text><text start="57.239" dur="4.721">sine wave pattern so if you wanted

dur="4.961">winter months you&amp;#39;d want to be able to</text><text start="66.159" dur="5.521">answer a question like this what is the</text><text start="68.84" dur="3.919">average value of that sign function over</text><text start="71.68" dur="3.6">half of its</text><text start="72.759" dur="4.561">period whereas a case like this is going</text><text start="75.28" dur="4.159">to have all sorts of constants mucking</text><text start="77.32" dur="4.799">up the function you and I are just going</text><text start="79.439" dur="4.64">to focus on a pure unencumbered s of X</text><text start="82.119" dur="3.841">function but the substance of the</text><text start="84.079" dur="3.201">approach would be totally the same in</text><text start="85.96" dur="3.159">any other</text><text start="87.28" dur="3.24">application it&amp;#39;s kind of a weird</text><text start="89.119" dur="3.721">question to think about about though</text><text start="90.52" dur="4.84">isn&amp;#39;t it the average of a continuous</text><text start="92.84" dur="4.599">variable usually with averages we think</text><text start="95.36" dur="4.439">of a finite number of variables where</text><text start="97.439" dur="5.481">you can add them all up and divide that</text><text start="99.799" dur="3.121">sum by how many there</text><text start="103.479" dur="6.161">are but there are infinitely many values</text><text start="106.759" dur="4.761">of sin of X between 0 and pi and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="109.64" dur="4.96">not like we can just add up all of those</text><text start="111.52" dur="4.84">numbers and divide by Infinity now this</text><text start="114.6" dur="3.799">sensation actually comes up a lot in</text><text start="116.36" dur="4">math and it&amp;#39;s worth remembering where</text><text start="118.399" dur="4">you have this vague sense that what you</text><text start="120.36" dur="5.079">want to do is add together infinitely</text><text start="122.399" dur="4.64">many values associated with a Continuum</text><text start="125.439" dur="4.24">even though that doesn&amp;#39;t really make</text><text start="127.039" dur="4.92">sense and almost always when you get</text><text start="129.679" dur="4.92">that sense the key is going to be to use</text><text start="131.959" dur="5.201">an integral somehow and to think through</text><text start="134.599" dur="4.881">exactly how a good first step is usually</text><text start="137.16" dur="5.32">to just approximate your situation with</text><text start="139.48" dur="5.08">some kind of finite sum in this case</text><text start="142.48" dur="5.32">imagine sampling a finite number of</text><text start="144.56" dur="5.44">points evenly spaced along this range</text><text start="147.8" dur="4.2">since it&amp;#39;s a finite sample you can find</text><text start="150" dur="4.56">the average by just adding up all of the</text><text start="152" dur="4.879">heights s of X at each one of these and</text><text start="154.56" dur="5.2">then dividing that sum by the number of</text><text start="156.879" dur="5.121">points that you sampled right and</text><text start="159.76" dur="4.559">presumably if the idea of an average</text><text start="162" dur="4.599">height among all infinitely many points</text><text start="164.319" dur="4.041">is going to make any sense at all the</text><text start="166.599" dur="4.041">more points we sample which would</text><text start="168.36" dur="4.28">involve adding up more and more Heights</text><text start="170.64" dur="4.36">the closer the average of that sample</text><text start="172.64" dur="3.599">should be to the actual average of the</text><text start="175" dur="3.64">continuous</text><text start="176.239" dur="4">variable and this should feel at least</text><text start="178.64" dur="4.44">somewhat related to taking taking an</text><text start="180.239" dur="4.92">integral of sin of X between 0 and Pi</text><text start="183.08" dur="4.76">even if it might not be exactly clear</text><text start="185.159" dur="5.041">how the two ideas match up for that</text><text start="187.84" dur="4.959">integral remember you also think of a</text><text start="190.2" dur="4.56">sample of inputs on this Continuum but</text><text start="192.799" dur="4.08">instead of adding the height sine of x</text><text start="194.76" dur="6.24">at each one and dividing by how many</text><text start="196.879" dur="7.521">there are you add up sin of x * DX where</text><text start="201" dur="5.519">DX is the spacing between the samples</text><text start="204.4" dur="5.16">that is you&amp;#39;re adding up little areas</text><text start="206.519" dur="5.28">not Heights and technically the integral</text><text start="209.56" dur="6.039">is not quite this sum it&amp;#39;s whatever that</text><text start="211.799" dur="5.761">sum approaches as DX approaches zero but</text><text start="215.599" dur="3.801">it is actually quite helpful to reason</text><text start="217.56" dur="3.84">with respect to one of these finite</text><text start="219.4" dur="4.52">iterations where we&amp;#39;re looking at a</text><text start="221.4" dur="3.839">concrete sides for DX and some specific</text><text start="223.92" dur="3.599">number of</text><text start="225.239" dur="4.64">rectangles so what you want to do here</text><text start="227.519" dur="4.8">is reframe this expression for the</text><text start="229.879" dur="4.881">average this sum of the heights divided</text><text start="232.319" dur="5.64">by the number of sampled points in terms</text><text start="234.76" dur="5.8">of DX the spacing between</text><text start="237.959" dur="6.161">samples and now if I tell you that the</text><text start="240.56" dur="5.759">spacing between these points is say 0.1</text><text start="244.12" dur="6.319">and you know that they range from 0 to</text><text start="246.319" dur="7.12">Pi can you tell me how many there</text><text start="250.439" dur="5.881">are well you can take the length of that</text><text start="253.439" dur="6.08">interval pi and divide it by the length</text><text start="256.32" dur="5.159">of the space between each sample if it</text><text start="259.519" dur="3.321">doesn&amp;#39;t go in perfectly evenly you would</text><text start="261.479" dur="3.881">have to round down to the nearest</text><text start="262.84" dur="5.56">integer but as an approximation this is</text><text start="265.36" dur="6.24">completely fine so if we write that</text><text start="268.4" dur="5.68">spacing between samples as DX the number</text><text start="271.6" dur="5.28">of samples is Pi /</text><text start="274.08" dur="5.119">DX and when we substitute that into our</text><text start="276.88" dur="4.64">expression up here you can rearrange it</text><text start="279.199" dur="3.521">putting that DX up top and distributing</text><text start="281.52" dur="3.88">it into the</text><text start="282.72" dur="5.88">sum but think about what it means to</text><text start="285.4" dur="5">distribute that DX up top it means that</text><text start="288.6" dur="5.2">the terms you&amp;#39;re adding up will look</text><text start="290.4" dur="5.92">like sin of x * DX for the various</text><text start="293.8" dur="4.8">inputs X that you&amp;#39;re sampling so that</text><text start="296.32" dur="5.12">numerator looks exactly like an integral</text><text start="298.6" dur="5.28">expression and so for larger and larger</text><text start="301.44" dur="4.96">samples of points this average will</text><text start="303.88" dur="5.2">approach the actual integral of s of X</text><text start="306.4" dur="5.799">between 0 and Pi all divided by the</text><text start="309.08" dur="5.52">length of that interval Pi in other</text><text start="312.199" dur="6.12">words the average height of this graph</text><text start="314.6" dur="5.439">is this area divided by its width on an</text><text start="318.319" dur="3.561">intuitive level and just thinking in</text><text start="320.039" dur="4.841">terms of units that feels pretty</text><text start="321.88" dur="4.599">reasonable doesn&amp;#39;t it area divid width</text><text start="324.88" dur="4.36">gives you an average</text><text start="326.479" dur="6.201">height so with this expression in hand</text><text start="329.24" dur="5.64">let&amp;#39;s solve it as we saw last video to</text><text start="332.68" dur="4.4">compute an integral you need to find an</text><text start="334.88" dur="4.759">anti-derivative of the function inside</text><text start="337.08" dur="5.52">the integral some other function whose</text><text start="339.639" dur="4.84">derivative is sin of X and if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="342.6" dur="4.08">comfortable with derivatives of trig</text><text start="344.479" dur="5.56">functions you know that the derivative</text><text start="346.68" dur="5.84">of cosine is negative s so if you just</text><text start="350.039" dur="4.641">negate that negative cosine is the</text><text start="352.52" dur="4.84">function we want the anti-derivative of</text><text start="354.68" dur="5.56">sign and to gut check yourself on that</text><text start="357.36" dur="5.8">look at this graph of negative cosine at</text><text start="360.24" dur="5.6">zero the slope is zero and then it</text><text start="363.16" dur="5.759">increases up to some Maximum slope at Pi</text><text start="365.84" dur="6.96">Hales and then goes back down to zero at</text><text start="368.919" dur="5.84">pi and in general its slope does indeed</text><text start="372.8" dur="3.239">seem to match the height of the sign</text><text start="374.759" dur="3.521">graph at every</text><text start="376.039" dur="4.6">point so what do we have to do to</text><text start="378.28" dur="5.319">evaluate the integral of sign between 0</text><text start="380.639" dur="5.361">and Pi well we evaluate this</text><text start="383.599" dur="4.681">anti-derivative at the upper bound and</text><text start="386" dur="5.44">subtract off its value at the lower</text><text start="388.28" dur="5.44">bound visually that is the difference in</text><text start="391.44" dur="5.92">the height of this negative cosine graph</text><text start="393.72" dur="6.28">above pi and its height at zero and as</text><text start="397.36" dur="5.44">you can see that change in height is</text><text start="400" dur="5.199">exactly two that&amp;#39;s kind of interesting</text><text start="402.8" dur="4.839">isn&amp;#39;t it that the area under this sign</text><text start="405.199" dur="5.56">graph turns out to be exactly</text><text start="407.639" dur="5.441">two so the answer to our average height</text><text start="410.759" dur="4.681">problem this integral divided by the</text><text start="413.08" dur="8.16">width of the region evidently turns out</text><text start="415.44" dur="7.52">to be 2 / Pi which is around 0.64</text><text start="421.24" dur="3.76">I promised at the start that this</text><text start="422.96" dur="4.48">question of finding the average of a</text><text start="425" dur="4.4">function offers an alternate perspective</text><text start="427.44" dur="4.68">on why integrals and derivatives are</text><text start="429.4" dur="5.199">inverses of each other why the area</text><text start="432.12" dur="4.16">under one graph has anything to do with</text><text start="434.599" dur="4.44">the slope of another</text><text start="436.28" dur="6.039">graph notice how finding this average</text><text start="439.039" dur="6.521">value 2 / Pi came down to looking at the</text><text start="442.319" dur="5.801">change in the anti-derivative cosine X</text><text start="445.56" dur="4.919">over the input range divided by the</text><text start="448.12" dur="3.88">length of that range</text><text start="450.479" dur="4.801">and another way to think about that</text><text start="452" dur="5.319">fraction is as the rise overrun slope</text><text start="455.28" dur="4.639">between the point of the anti-derivative</text><text start="457.319" dur="4">graph below zero and the point of that</text><text start="459.919" dur="4.161">graph above</text><text start="461.319" dur="5.16">pi and now think about why it might make</text><text start="464.08" dur="5.16">sense that this slope would represent an</text><text start="466.479" dur="5.84">average value of s of X on that</text><text start="469.24" dur="5.399">region well by definition sin of X is</text><text start="472.319" dur="5">the derivative of this anti-derivative</text><text start="474.639" dur="5.721">graph it gives us the slope of negative</text><text start="477.319" dur="5.521">cosine at every point so another way to</text><text start="480.36" dur="5.239">think about the average value of s of X</text><text start="482.84" dur="6.6">is as the average slope over all tangent</text><text start="485.599" dur="5.801">lines here between zero and pi and when</text><text start="489.44" dur="3.68">you view things like that doesn&amp;#39;t it</text><text start="491.4" dur="4.16">make a lot of sense that the average</text><text start="493.12" dur="4.72">slope of a graph over all of its points</text><text start="495.56" dur="6.16">in a certain range should equal the</text><text start="497.84" dur="3.88">total slope between the start and end</text><text start="502.52" dur="4.16">points to digest this idea it helps to</text><text start="505.24" dur="4.919">think about what it looks like for a</text><text start="506.68" dur="5.599">general function for any function f of X</text><text start="510.159" dur="5.601">if you want to find its average value on</text><text start="512.279" dur="6.041">some interval say between A and B what</text><text start="515.76" dur="4.8">you do is take the integral of f on that</text><text start="518.32" dur="5.56">interval divided by the width of that</text><text start="520.56" dur="5.48">interval B minus a you can think of this</text><text start="523.88" dur="5">as the area under the graph divided by</text><text start="526.04" dur="5.68">its width or more accurately it is the</text><text start="528.88" dur="5.639">signed area of that graph since any area</text><text start="531.72" dur="4.92">below the x-axis is counted as</text><text start="534.519" dur="4.201">negative and it&amp;#39;s worth taking a moment</text><text start="536.64" dur="4.04">to remember what this area has to do</text><text start="538.72" dur="4">with the usual notion of a finite</text><text start="540.68" dur="4.52">average where you add up many numbers</text><text start="542.72" dur="4.52">and divide by how many there are when</text><text start="545.2" dur="5.28">you take some sample of points spaced</text><text start="547.24" dur="5">out by DX the number of samples is about</text><text start="550.48" dur="5">equal to the length of the interval</text><text start="552.24" dur="5.8">divided by DX so if you add up the</text><text start="555.48" dur="4.88">values of F ofx at each sample and</text><text start="558.04" dur="5">divide by the total number of samples</text><text start="560.36" dur="5.96">it&amp;#39;s the same as adding up the product f</text><text start="563.04" dur="5.88">ofx * DX and dividing by the width of</text><text start="566.32" dur="4.84">the entire interval the only difference</text><text start="568.92" dur="4.599">between that and the integral is that</text><text start="571.16" dur="4.28">the integral asks what happens as DX</text><text start="573.519" dur="3.601">approaches zero but that just</text><text start="575.44" dur="3.639">corresponds with samples of more and</text><text start="577.12" dur="4.04">more points that approximate the true</text><text start="579.079" dur="5.601">average increasingly</text><text start="581.16" dur="5.919">well now for any integral evaluating it</text><text start="584.68" dur="6.24">comes down to finding an anti-derivative</text><text start="587.079" dur="6.961">of f ofx commonly denoted capital F</text><text start="590.92" dur="6.32">ofx what we want is the change to this</text><text start="594.04" dur="6.479">anti-derivative between A and B capital</text><text start="597.24" dur="5.76">F of B minus capital F of a a which you</text><text start="600.519" dur="5.041">can think of as the change in height of</text><text start="603" dur="4.92">this new graph between the two</text><text start="605.56" dur="4.68">bounds I&amp;#39;ve conveniently chosen an</text><text start="607.92" dur="4.72">anti-derivative that passes through zero</text><text start="610.24" dur="4.76">at the lower bound here but keep in mind</text><text start="612.64" dur="4.8">you can freely shift this up and down</text><text start="615" dur="5.2">adding whatever constant you want to it</text><text start="617.44" dur="5">and it would still be a valid</text><text start="620.2" dur="4.639">anti-derivative so the solution to the</text><text start="622.44" dur="5.28">average problem is the change in the</text><text start="624.839" dur="5.12">height of this new graph divided by the</text><text start="627.72" dur="5.559">change to the x value between between a</text><text start="629.959" dur="5.361">and b in other words it is the slope of</text><text start="633.279" dur="4.881">the anti-derivative graph between the</text><text start="635.32" dur="4.72">two end points and again when you stop</text><text start="638.16" dur="5.04">to think about it that should make a lot</text><text start="640.04" dur="5.28">of sense because little F ofx gives us</text><text start="643.2" dur="5.12">the slope of the tangent line to this</text><text start="645.32" dur="6.639">graph at each point after all it is by</text><text start="648.32" dur="7.28">definition the derivative of capital</text><text start="651.959" dur="4.601">F so why are anti-derivatives the key to</text><text start="655.6" dur="3.32">solving</text><text start="656.56" dur="4.519">integrals well my favorite intuition is</text><text start="658.92" dur="4.52">still the one that I showed last video</text><text start="661.079" dur="4.56">but a second perspective is that when</text><text start="663.44" dur="5.36">you reframe the question of finding an</text><text start="665.639" dur="5.361">average of a continuous value as instead</text><text start="668.8" dur="5.08">finding the average slope of a bunch of</text><text start="671" dur="5.399">tangent lines it lets you see the answer</text><text start="673.88" dur="4.56">just by comparing end points rather than</text><text start="676.399" dur="4.521">having to actually tally up all of the</text><text start="678.44" dur="2.48">points in</text><text start="682.279" dur="4.201">between in the last video I described a</text><text start="684.76" dur="4.04">sensation that should bring integrals to</text><text start="686.48" dur="3.84">your mind namely if you feel like the</text><text start="688.8" dur="4.039">problem you&amp;#39;re solving could be</text><text start="690.32" dur="4.959">approximated by breaking it up somehow</text><text start="692.839" dur="5.081">and adding up a large number of small</text><text start="695.279" dur="4.8">things and here I want you to come away</text><text start="697.92" dur="4.8">recognizing a second Sensation that</text><text start="700.079" dur="4.88">should also bring integrals to your mind</text><text start="702.72"
