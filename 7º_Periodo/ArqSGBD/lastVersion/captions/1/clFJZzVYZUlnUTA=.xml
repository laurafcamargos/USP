<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.32" dur="4.479">in my last video about electricity the</text><text start="2.639" dur="4.481">thumbnail asked the question does</text><text start="4.799" dur="4.961">electricity travel at the speed of light</text><text start="7.12" dur="4.32">and i got a lot of comments that said no</text><text start="9.76" dur="4.72">of course not because electrons have</text><text start="11.44" dur="4.64">mass and wires have resistance so</text><text start="14.48" dur="3.76">electricity can&amp;#39;t travel at the speed of</text><text start="16.08" dur="5.039">light now the conclusion that i arrive</text><text start="18.24" dur="4.64">at in that video is that electricity</text><text start="21.119" dur="3.681">does travel at the speed of light or</text><text start="22.88" dur="3.68">it&amp;#39;s at least so close to the speed of</text><text start="24.8" dur="4.639">light that for all intents and purposes</text><text start="26.56" dur="4.559">you can just use c to calculate it but</text><text start="29.439" dur="4.561">based on all those questions about</text><text start="31.119" dur="4.881">resistance of wire today i&amp;#39;m gonna test</text><text start="34" dur="5.28">that so</text><text start="36" dur="5.92">in my effort to be like the strangest</text><text start="39.28" dur="5.119">neighbor possible i have spent</text><text start="41.92" dur="5.2">the last few days well i set it up the</text><text start="44.399" dur="5.361">first time like six months ago but</text><text start="47.12" dur="6.24">i have set up a huge loop of wire in my</text><text start="49.76" dur="6.72">front yard and the same electronic setup</text><text start="53.36" dur="4.96">that i used in my last video to time how</text><text start="56.48" dur="3.84">long it takes electricity to go around</text><text start="58.32" dur="4.8">this loop but i don&amp;#39;t just have one loop</text><text start="60.32" dur="4.239">of wire i have three loops of wire with</text><text start="63.12" dur="3.039">different resistances different</text><text start="64.559" dur="3.601">thicknesses of wire</text><text start="66.159" dur="12.561">we&amp;#39;re gonna see if there&amp;#39;s a difference</text><text start="68.16" dur="12.48">[Music]</text><text start="78.72" dur="4.56">this is almost the same setup that i</text><text start="80.64" dur="4.96">used in the previous video the obvious</text><text start="83.28" dur="4.8">difference being that there&amp;#39;s only one</text><text start="85.6" dur="4.72">loop of wire in the previous video i had</text><text start="88.08" dur="4.24">a loop going out from the battery and</text><text start="90.32" dur="3.68">switch in both directions and then</text><text start="92.32" dur="3.839">approaching the resistor or the light</text><text start="94" dur="3.52">bulb that was the load and one of those</text><text start="96.159" dur="3.681">loops really didn&amp;#39;t matter so i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="97.52" dur="4.16">removed it the other really big change i</text><text start="99.84" dur="4">guess really small change i don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="101.68" dur="3.92">is that the loop isn&amp;#39;t 500 meters</text><text start="103.84" dur="4">anymore it&amp;#39;s only 12 meters because it</text><text start="105.6" dur="4.32">needs to fit in my front yard the whole</text><text start="107.84" dur="4.08">timing setup and how it looks on the</text><text start="109.92" dur="3.76">oscilloscope should be exactly the same</text><text start="111.92" dur="3.44">the way this is wired actually didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="113.68" dur="3.439">have to make it exactly the same i could</text><text start="115.36" dur="4">have used a simpler setup but for the</text><text start="117.119" dur="4.64">sake of comparison it&amp;#39;s identical and we</text><text start="119.36" dur="3.84">can still see the delays very clearly on</text><text start="121.759" dur="3.601">the oscilloscope so let me show you how</text><text start="123.2" dur="3.519">that works so the big loop of wire that</text><text start="125.36" dur="3.84">extends all the way out there through</text><text start="126.719" dur="5.041">the front yard comes back to this</text><text start="129.2" dur="5.2">circuit so i have this electronic switch</text><text start="131.76" dur="4.559">here and when this switch is open as in</text><text start="134.4" dur="3.919">before we have flipped the switch and</text><text start="136.319" dur="4.721">started to flow current through the loop</text><text start="138.319" dur="5.441">it&amp;#39;s basically holding the entire loop</text><text start="141.04" dur="7.04">at about one volt potential now the</text><text start="143.76" dur="6.88">actual amount of charge in a wire is</text><text start="148.08" dur="4">in my mind the best analog for voltage</text><text start="150.64" dur="3.28">that you can come up with it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="152.08" dur="3.84">perfect because it changes with the</text><text start="153.92" dur="4.24">local capacitance of the wires and stuff</text><text start="155.92" dur="3.28">like that but basically when this</text><text start="158.16" dur="3.28">circuit</text><text start="159.2" dur="4.399">applies a volt to the whole wire it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="161.44" dur="4.24">depleting that wire of electrons i</text><text start="163.599" dur="3.761">actually made an attempt to measure how</text><text start="165.68" dur="4.32">many electrons i was removing from the</text><text start="167.36" dur="5.36">wire and got an answer somewhere in the</text><text start="170" dur="6.16">realm of two or three hundred million</text><text start="172.72" dur="5.599">electrons now that sounds like a lot of</text><text start="176.16" dur="3.84">electrons it&amp;#39;s a lot of particles but if</text><text start="178.319" dur="4.161">you look at the number of free electrons</text><text start="180" dur="4.8">that are in the wire that&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="182.48" dur="4.88">less than a quadrillionth</text><text start="184.8" dur="4.56">of the free electrons in the wire so it</text><text start="187.36" dur="4.72">doesn&amp;#39;t really seem like very much but</text><text start="189.36" dur="5.92">it actually is and i&amp;#39;ll talk more about</text><text start="192.08" dur="5.12">that later when this switch closes it</text><text start="195.28" dur="4.64">launches a whole bunch of electrons all</text><text start="197.2" dur="4.64">at once into this alligator clip which</text><text start="199.92" dur="3.76">then start that wave propagation thing</text><text start="201.84" dur="4.319">and when that wave goes all the way</text><text start="203.68" dur="4.16">around the loop and comes back then</text><text start="206.159" dur="3.841">current starts flowing through this</text><text start="207.84" dur="4.08">resistor and we can measure that on the</text><text start="210" dur="3.68">scope if you saw the last video this</text><text start="211.92" dur="5.84">graph is not going to surprise you the</text><text start="213.68" dur="5.68">x-axis here is time and the y-axis is</text><text start="217.76" dur="3.92">voltage and we&amp;#39;re looking at a variety</text><text start="219.36" dur="5.439">of signals within the circuit the yellow</text><text start="221.68" dur="6.24">trace is the switch so when this trace</text><text start="224.799" dur="4.8">goes from low to high that is when we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="227.92" dur="3.44">actually flipped the switch we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="229.599" dur="4.241">launched our pulse of electricity into</text><text start="231.36" dur="4.799">the circuit the white trace is the</text><text start="233.84" dur="4.319">voltage at the other end of the loop so</text><text start="236.159" dur="3.521">this is the signal that has gone all the</text><text start="238.159" dur="3.121">way through the loop and come back that</text><text start="239.68" dur="4.16">we have to wait for</text><text start="241.28" dur="8.08">and if you actually go look and see how</text><text start="243.84" dur="5.52">far this is we can measure in time</text><text start="251.84" dur="5.119">that&amp;#39;s uh</text><text start="255.12" dur="4">let&amp;#39;s get it right there yeah that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="256.959" dur="5.921">almost 100 nanoseconds that&amp;#39;s 98</text><text start="259.12" dur="6">nanoseconds so it takes electricity</text><text start="262.88" dur="5.2">98 nanoseconds to go through that loop</text><text start="265.12" dur="5.519">when we send this pulse into the loop 98</text><text start="268.08" dur="4.399">nanoseconds we get this pulse back out</text><text start="270.639" dur="4.481">the other end so i know that the loop of</text><text start="272.479" dur="5.121">wire out there is exactly 28 meters long</text><text start="275.12" dur="4">because i measured it earlier but</text><text start="277.6" dur="3.2">before you actually get to the scope</text><text start="279.12" dur="3.76">probes where the measurement is made</text><text start="280.8" dur="4.64">there&amp;#39;s an alligator clip on both sides</text><text start="282.88" dur="6.56">so that will add 40</text><text start="285.44" dur="4">centimeters on each end</text><text start="290.88" dur="6.48">so if i take 28.8 meters and divide it</text><text start="294.479" dur="5.361">by 98 nanoseconds</text><text start="297.36" dur="2.48">we get</text><text start="300.36" dur="4.92">2.939 meters per second</text><text start="303.12" dur="5.2">that is almost c</text><text start="305.28" dur="5.12">98 the speed of light so in the last</text><text start="308.32" dur="3.76">video i guess i didn&amp;#39;t know exactly how</text><text start="310.4" dur="5.12">long the wire was so i couldn&amp;#39;t make</text><text start="312.08" dur="7.44">this calculation but here i can say that</text><text start="315.52" dur="6.48">the speed of electricity is 98</text><text start="319.52" dur="4.239">of c in this configuration that i&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="322" dur="2.639">right now using</text><text start="323.759" dur="4.561">the</text><text start="324.639" dur="5.361">2.4 ohm magnet wire now i also have a</text><text start="328.32" dur="5.12">thinner magnet wire with a total</text><text start="330" dur="6.32">resistance of 6.3 ohms across the entire</text><text start="333.44" dur="5.12">loop and that wire has the exact same</text><text start="336.32" dur="4.879">enamel coating on it as the wire that i</text><text start="338.56" dur="4.639">just tested so it should have the same</text><text start="341.199" dur="4.961">dielectric properties and we should get</text><text start="343.199" dur="4.72">the exact same speed despite the fact</text><text start="346.16" dur="4.759">that it&amp;#39;s a significantly different</text><text start="347.919" dur="3">resistance</text><text start="360.56" dur="6.4">so with the new wire hooked up</text><text start="363.28" dur="5.52">that cursor is still right on the money</text><text start="366.96" dur="4.239">we have not changed the propagation</text><text start="368.8" dur="5.92">speed one bit</text><text start="371.199" dur="3.521">98 nanoseconds</text><text start="376.56" dur="6.079">it is fun when physics works cool but</text><text start="379.36" dur="5.839">wait there&amp;#39;s more i also have thicker</text><text start="382.639" dur="4.881">wire so it&amp;#39;s some of this stuff soldered</text><text start="385.199" dur="5.361">together into you know a big 28 meter</text><text start="387.52" dur="6.72">loop and this is actually multi-stranded</text><text start="390.56" dur="5.6">wire and because it&amp;#39;s so much larger</text><text start="394.24" dur="5.679">across the entire loop it only has a</text><text start="396.16" dur="6.08">resistance of 0.9 ohms so it&amp;#39;s a much</text><text start="399.919" dur="4.881">lower resistance case i would expect</text><text start="402.24" dur="4.959">that as bare wire this would propagate</text><text start="404.8" dur="4">the electric signal at exactly the same</text><text start="407.199" dur="3.601">speed as the magnet wire that i just</text><text start="408.8" dur="4.88">tested the only thing that could throw a</text><text start="410.8" dur="5.76">wrench in that is that this is not</text><text start="413.68" dur="4.959">enameled wire it&amp;#39;s got this thick like</text><text start="416.56" dur="3.44">rubber insulation on the outside which</text><text start="418.639" dur="3.68">is going to have a slightly different</text><text start="420" dur="4.319">dielectric effect and could end up</text><text start="422.319" dur="4.88">slowing the signal down just a tiny</text><text start="424.319" dur="4.88">little bit we&amp;#39;ll see</text><text start="427.199" dur="4.081">i&amp;#39;m very curious i also want to point</text><text start="429.199" dur="3.28">out that although it shouldn&amp;#39;t matter</text><text start="431.28" dur="3.44">one bit</text><text start="432.479" dur="4.641">i am actually only hanging one of these</text><text start="434.72" dur="4.64">wires at a time i&amp;#39;m suspending it off</text><text start="437.12" dur="4.079">the ground in order to keep it away from</text><text start="439.36" dur="4">the wires that i&amp;#39;m not using i just have</text><text start="441.199" dur="4.4">the other ones laying out here you know</text><text start="443.36" dur="4">a solid half a meter away so they should</text><text start="445.599" dur="3.921">have no impact</text><text start="447.36" dur="4">on the experiment</text><text start="449.52" dur="3.92">but i knew that if i didn&amp;#39;t say that</text><text start="451.36" dur="4.32">people would ask as i&amp;#39;m tripping through</text><text start="453.44" dur="3.599">one of the smaller wires thick wire is</text><text start="455.68" dur="3.84">all hooked up</text><text start="457.039" dur="6.761">moment of truth is it still going</text><text start="459.52" dur="4.28">through the loop at the same speed</text><text start="464.16" dur="4.159">maybe</text><text start="465.12" dur="6.479">i might call that</text><text start="468.319" dur="6">a little bit longer maybe 99 nanoseconds</text><text start="471.599" dur="5.361">or maybe maybe 100 nanoseconds it didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="474.319" dur="4.401">change very much but all for the for the</text><text start="476.96" dur="3.519">sake of argument here i&amp;#39;ll call this a</text><text start="478.72" dur="3.919">hundred i need six percent the speed of</text><text start="480.479" dur="4.241">light three wires three different</text><text start="482.639" dur="4.96">resistances</text><text start="484.72" dur="5.44">the exact same propagation speed really</text><text start="487.599" dur="6">within measurement error on all of them</text><text start="490.16" dur="6">and all of them are just about the speed</text><text start="493.599" dur="4.88">of light in a vacuum which is just about</text><text start="496.16" dur="3.759">the speed of light in air which just so</text><text start="498.479" dur="3.521">happens to be the thing that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="499.919" dur="4.4">surrounding these wires so if the</text><text start="502" dur="4.4">resistance of the wire doesn&amp;#39;t change</text><text start="504.319" dur="3.921">the speed at which electricity moves</text><text start="506.4" dur="4.479">through that wire</text><text start="508.24" dur="5.2">what does to answer that question we</text><text start="510.879" dur="5.52">really need to understand how electrons</text><text start="513.44" dur="4.64">push on each other through a wire as a</text><text start="516.399" dur="3.921">quick refresher let&amp;#39;s think about what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="518.08" dur="4">happening in this wire at the subatomic</text><text start="520.32" dur="3.599">scale when the switch is flipped the</text><text start="522.08" dur="3.92">electron density in the wire is a little</text><text start="523.919" dur="4.321">bit below average earlier i mentioned</text><text start="526" dur="4.24">that we only actually removed a half of</text><text start="528.24" dur="4.08">the quadrillion of the electrons that</text><text start="530.24" dur="4.08">are able to move in the wire but for the</text><text start="532.32" dur="4.079">sake of clarity in this diagram i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="534.32" dur="4.32">removed a quarter of the electrons when</text><text start="536.399" dur="4.481">we flip the switch all of a sudden we</text><text start="538.64" dur="4.72">dump a bunch of electrons into one end</text><text start="540.88" dur="4.16">of the wire these electrons want to</text><text start="543.36" dur="3.84">spread out and make the whole wire</text><text start="545.04" dur="5.2">neutral again but they don&amp;#39;t spread out</text><text start="547.2" dur="5.199">like this they spread out like this</text><text start="550.24" dur="4.4">where each electron just moves a tiny</text><text start="552.399" dur="4.721">bit until they&amp;#39;re all evenly spaced</text><text start="554.64" dur="4.879">again now in actuality if you want a</text><text start="557.12" dur="4.88">steady state current to flow in the wire</text><text start="559.519" dur="5.121">you can&amp;#39;t actually let the wire reach</text><text start="562" dur="4.88">equilibrium the electrons want to spread</text><text start="564.64" dur="4.319">out and make the whole wire neutral but</text><text start="566.88" dur="3.92">if the battery keeps pumping electrons</text><text start="568.959" dur="4.241">into one end of the wire then they never</text><text start="570.8" dur="4.56">have time to fully spread out this means</text><text start="573.2" dur="4.639">that in steady state electrons are</text><text start="575.36" dur="4.24">actually slightly denser right in front</text><text start="577.839" dur="4.321">of the negative end of the battery and</text><text start="579.6" dur="4.64">slightly less dense right in front of</text><text start="582.16" dur="4.48">the positive end of the battery</text><text start="584.24" dur="5.36">because electrons are charged particles</text><text start="586.64" dur="5.759">every single electron emanates from it</text><text start="589.6" dur="5.76">an electric field this is something that</text><text start="592.399" dur="5.12">is inherent to the particle like</text><text start="595.36" dur="4.24">you can&amp;#39;t have an electron and not have</text><text start="597.519" dur="5.361">it make an electric field other charged</text><text start="599.6" dur="5.52">particles are acted upon by this field</text><text start="602.88" dur="4.16">however the moment we flip the switch</text><text start="605.12" dur="4.32">and dump all these extra electrons into</text><text start="607.04" dur="4.4">the end of the wire the next electrons</text><text start="609.44" dur="4.8">in the wire don&amp;#39;t start moving right</text><text start="611.44" dur="5.12">away they need to sense the field of the</text><text start="614.24" dur="4.24">electrons inside the switch and this</text><text start="616.56" dur="3.76">field doesn&amp;#39;t travel instantly it</text><text start="618.48" dur="4.08">travels at the speed of light once this</text><text start="620.32" dur="4.32">electron scoots forward a bit it&amp;#39;s now</text><text start="622.56" dur="4.8">emitting its own field from a slightly</text><text start="624.64" dur="5.36">different place but the next electron</text><text start="627.36" dur="4.64">again doesn&amp;#39;t know that yet and has to</text><text start="630" dur="4.64">wait for the field to update at the</text><text start="632" dur="5.12">speed of light before it scoots forward</text><text start="634.64" dur="4.08">updates its field and so on the signal</text><text start="637.12" dur="4.159">we just measured the speed of</text><text start="638.72" dur="4.799">electricity is not the speed that an</text><text start="641.279" dur="4.321">electron moves through the wire it&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="643.519" dur="4">time that it takes for an electric field</text><text start="645.6" dur="4.08">to reach an electron and for that</text><text start="647.519" dur="4.56">electron to respond by twitching</text><text start="649.68" dur="5.04">imperceptibly forward in the wire so</text><text start="652.079" dur="5.2">that it can in turn apply a tiny force</text><text start="654.72" dur="5.28">to the next and this wave of motion</text><text start="657.279" dur="4.881">happens very quickly so if you want to</text><text start="660" dur="4.399">slow down electricity

dur="5.201">frequency radiation passing through</text><text start="961.6" dur="4.32">water so if we just predicted that water</text><text start="964.16" dur="4.88">was going to slow down the

dur="5.04">sort of slight rearrangement of the</text><text start="989.36" dur="5.36">electron cloud that happens like</text><text start="991.92" dur="5.359">instantly almost instantly because the</text><text start="994.72" dur="4.799">distances are so tiny and the amount of</text><text start="997.279" dur="3.92">stuff that has to move is so tiny that</text><text start="999.519" dur="2.88">just happens</text><text start="1001.199" dur="3.361">next</text><text start="1002.399" dur="5.12">the whole molecule starts to rotate but</text><text start="1004.56" dur="5.36">that

is</text><text start="1044.88" dur="3.6">that we have shown that flipping a</text><text start="1047.52" dur="3.84">switch</text><text start="1048.48" dur="5.04">is actually closer in</text><text
