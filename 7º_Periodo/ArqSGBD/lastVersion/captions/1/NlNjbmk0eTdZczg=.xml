dur="6">its sole purpose is to turn itself off I</text><text start="39.739" dur="4.66">really wanted to get the switch</text><text start="41.879" dur="5.16">displaced from the arm so the arm would</text><text start="44.399" dur="4.89">really have to like reach out and you</text><text start="47.039" dur="4.8">hit the switch I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of</text><text start="49.289" dur="4.71">designs online where there&amp;#39;s a single</text><text start="51.839" dur="3.72">motor and it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a cam almost</text><text start="53.999" dur="3.031">there&amp;#39;s just an arm that reaches out and</text><text start="55.559" dur="4.381">it just rotates out and hits the switch</text><text start="57.03" dur="4.949">and goes back in and if you can only see</text><text start="59.94" dur="3.84">like a finger sticking out or a little</text><text start="61.979" dur="3.481">hand on the end of an arm is what it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="63.78" dur="4.05">supposed to look like then that works</text><text start="65.46" dur="5.28">fine but I wanted to be able to see a</text><text start="67.83" dur="4.47">lot of the arm which means that it was</text><text start="70.74" dur="3.63">going to end up looking like a wheel</text><text start="72.3" dur="4.26">coming out and I didn&amp;#39;t want that so I</text><text start="74.37" dur="4.02">needed to have something that</text><text start="76.56" dur="4.14">articulated and moved in a slightly more</text><text start="78.39" dur="5.7">linear motion and that&amp;#39;s how i came up</text><text start="80.7" dur="6.09">with this for segment arm getting this</text><text start="84.09" dur="4.86">articulation right in cab took me</text><text start="86.79" dur="5.55">forever and my uncertainty that it would</text><text start="88.95" dur="5.31">ever work meant that the file reasonably</text><text start="92.34" dur="4.02">complete actually sat in cad for about a</text><text start="94.26" dur="3.99">year before i went to get the parts made</text><text start="96.36" dur="3.78">because i wasn&amp;#39;t convinced that they</text><text start="98.25" dur="3.72">would function the wonderful thing about</text><text start="100.14" dur="4.02">laser cutting and 3d printing is that</text><text start="101.97" dur="4.14">you can define pretty bizarre shapes to</text><text start="104.16" dur="3.66">great precision and convert them from</text><text start="106.11" dur="4.8">digital to physical with just a few</text><text start="107.82" dur="5.22">clicks so I really enjoy that for this</text><text start="110.91" dur="5.16">project there wasn&amp;#39;t a lot of finishing</text><text start="113.04" dur="5.1">even so I just printed the parts and cut</text><text start="116.07" dur="3.9">out the parts and a couple of the</text><text start="118.14" dur="3.24">printed parts needed to be painted but</text><text start="119.97" dur="3.72">other than that it basically just had to</text><text start="121.38" dur="4.44">be assembled and tested at that point</text><text start="123.69" dur="4.53">the difficult part was the electronics</text><text start="125.82" dur="5.639">so there are a lot of really cool</text><text start="128.22" dur="4.83">designs online that use Arduino zor</text><text start="131.459" dur="4.951">other microcontrollers or something like</text><text start="133.05" dur="5.13">that in order to basically put different</text><text start="136.41" dur="3.27">programs in for the arm so when you</text><text start="138.18" dur="3.33">press the switch</text><text start="139.68" dur="3.779">we&amp;#39;ll do something other than</text><text start="141.51" dur="4.92">immediately turn on hit the thing and</text><text start="143.459" dur="4.351">come back which is the simplest circuit</text><text start="146.43" dur="3.179">just when you press the switch the motor</text><text start="147.81" dur="4.409">turns on it presses the switch and it</text><text start="149.609" dur="4.11">reverses then it stops so adding a</text><text start="152.219" dur="4.951">little bit more complexity than that</text><text start="153.719" dur="4.621">adds a lot of personality to the project</text><text start="157.17" dur="3.06">and that&amp;#39;s what I really wanted to</text><text start="158.34" dur="4.619">achieve but when you use a</text><text start="160.23" dur="4.589">microcontroller you would either have to</text><text start="162.959" dur="3.571">wait for it to boot up every time that</text><text start="164.819" dur="4.76">you press the switch before it would do</text><text start="166.53" dur="4.709">anything which is not a good option or</text><text start="169.579" dur="4.421">you would have to have the</text><text start="171.239" dur="5.491">microcontroller on all the time which is</text><text start="174" dur="5.189">draining power all the time which is not</text><text start="176.73" dur="5.069">a good option so I ended up going with</text><text start="179.189" dur="5.071">an analog solution that allowed me to</text><text start="181.799" dur="5.58">add a little bit of extra complexity and</text><text start="184.26" dur="5.099">save my battery and that was using a</text><text start="187.379" dur="5">whole bunch of timers and i ended up</text><text start="189.359" dur="5.31">theming the the box around this</text><text start="192.379" dur="5.11">hitchhikers guide panic versus don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="194.669" dur="4.77">panic on the switch so the switch is</text><text start="197.489" dur="4.801">normally set to don&amp;#39;t panic and when you</text><text start="199.439" dur="4.621">press it to panic the siren goes off and</text><text start="202.29" dur="3.059">then after the sirens going off for a</text><text start="204.06" dur="4.23">minute it&amp;#39;s like the robot finally</text><text start="205.349" dur="5.7">figures it out and comes out and presses</text><text start="208.29" dur="4.529">the switch turns off the siren says that</text><text start="211.049" dur="4.65">you should go back to don&amp;#39;t panic and</text><text start="212.819" dur="5.34">then goes back inside the box and ways</text><text start="215.699" dur="4.44">for you to panic again one really great</text><text start="218.159" dur="4.711">thing about the circuit is that there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="220.139" dur="7.171">a glitch or maybe an unintended feature</text><text start="222.87" dur="7.259">that on the reset pin of one of the five</text><text start="227.31" dur="5.459">by five timers there&amp;#39;s a bit of variance</text><text start="230.129" dur="4.44">which means that sometimes he doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="232.769" dur="3">wait for the siren to go off this comes</text><text start="234.569" dur="2.7">out and presses the switch immediately</text><text start="235.769" dur="5.521">so there&amp;#39;s a little bit of</text><text start="237.269" dur="6.571">unpredictability and if is substantially</text><text start="241.29" dur="5.159">funnier because of that useless machines</text><text start="243.84" dur="5">are really fantastic examples of time</text><text start="246.449" dur="5.16">independent logic or combinational logic</text><text start="248.84" dur="6.729">because there is no internal state this</text><text start="251.609" dur="5.85">this circuit has no memory there are two</text><text start="255.569" dur="4.621">switches that act as input there&amp;#39;s this</text><text start="257.459" dur="4.95">switch on the top that the human and</text><text start="260.19" dur="4.039">robot both hit and then there&amp;#39;s a switch</text><text start="262.409" dur="3.991">in the back that prevents the arm from</text><text start="264.229" dur="5.05">retracting all the way into the box and</text><text start="266.4" dur="4.949">just continuing to go so there&amp;#39;s two</text><text start="269.279" dur="3.441">switches to bits of input that means</text><text start="271.349" dur="3.561">there&amp;#39;s four possible in</text><text start="272.72" dur="4.95">it states both switches hi both switches</text><text start="274.91" dur="4.92">low one high and one low or one low on</text><text start="277.67" dur="3.99">one high this means we can define a</text><text start="279.83" dur="4.23">truth table where we&amp;#39;ve got four</text><text start="281.66" dur="3.84">different inputs and three different</text><text start="284.06" dur="3.66">outputs and for every one of those four</text><text start="285.5" dur="5.01">inputs one of these three outputs is</text><text start="287.72" dur="4.95">going to be happening and if I were to</text><text start="290.51" dur="4.26">flip this forward and then flip it back</text><text start="292.67" dur="3.87">before that starts to move it has no</text><text start="294.77" dur="4.23">knowledge that it wanted to reach out</text><text start="296.54" dur="4.32">and press the switch it just it actually</text><text start="299" dur="4.59">thinks that it has pressed the switch in</text><text start="300.86" dur="4.83">a way because it&amp;#39;s already received the</text><text start="303.59" dur="5.4">input that it&amp;#39;s done so it&amp;#39;s returning</text><text start="305.69" dur="6.75">home those basic useless machines</text><text start="308.99" dur="7.2">circuit requires a battery two switches</text><text start="312.44" dur="5.52">one diode and a DC motor so the DC motor</text><text start="316.19" dur="3.48">is what&amp;#39;s actually driving the arm and</text><text start="317.96" dur="4.83">if you reverse the polarity on a DC</text><text start="319.67" dur="4.68">motor it runs in Reverse so when you are</text><text start="322.79" dur="3.48">extending the arm you&amp;#39;re powering the</text><text start="324.35" dur="4.44">motor and basically flipping the leaves</text><text start="326.27" dur="5.01">on that motor is what causes the arm to</text><text start="328.79" dur="4.5">retract and flipping the leads on that</text><text start="331.28" dur="3.93">motor is accomplished by the switch that</text><text start="333.29" dur="3.51">the human and the robot are actually</text><text start="335.21" dur="3.3">fighting over which is a double pole</text><text start="336.8" dur="4.56">double throw switch that is basically</text><text start="338.51" dur="4.53">wired such that every time it gets hit</text><text start="341.36" dur="4.05">one way or the other the battery</text><text start="343.04" dur="4.85">polarity seems to flip to the rest of</text><text start="345.41" dur="5.009">the circuit the second switch is a</text><text start="347.89" dur="5.11">normally closed momentary switch and</text><text start="350.419" dur="4.861">it&amp;#39;s actually buried inside the box sort</text><text start="353" dur="4.32">of behind the arm so that when the arm</text><text start="355.28" dur="4.65">is retracting it runs into that switch</text><text start="357.32" dur="4.32">and thus which stops the arm from</text><text start="359.93" dur="5.28">retracting indefinitely because it&amp;#39;s got</text><text start="361.64" dur="6.3">to stop once it gets inside the box when</text><text start="365.21" dur="4.53">the arm is idle and nothing&amp;#39;s happening</text><text start="367.94" dur="4.65">in the circuit if the box is just there</text><text start="369.74" dur="5.19">sitting on your desk the double pole</text><text start="372.59" dur="4.32">double throw switch is positioned the</text><text start="374.93" dur="4.47">way it&amp;#39;s shown here and the normally</text><text start="376.91" dur="4.23">closed momentary is open because the arm</text><text start="379.4" dur="5.61">is retracted all the way and pressing on</text><text start="381.14" dur="5.7">the switch which means that when that</text><text start="385.01" dur="3.96">whole circuit is connected there&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="386.84" dur="3.96">current actually flowing except for the</text><text start="388.97" dur="5.55">reverse bias current through that diode</text><text start="390.8" dur="5.67">which is extremely small once the human</text><text start="394.52" dur="4.14">presses the switch the double pole</text><text start="396.47" dur="5.61">double throw switch is toggled to the</text><text start="398.66" dur="5.819">next position and that has the net</text><text start="402.08" dur="4.02">result of reversing the battery that is</text><text start="404.479" dur="3.721">applied to the rest of the</text><text start="406.1" dur="3.84">circuit which means that current can</text><text start="408.2" dur="3.33">flow through the motor and now through</text><text start="409.94" dur="3.93">that diode that used to be reverse</text><text start="411.53" dur="4.95">biased so the motor is actually running</text><text start="413.87" dur="6.36">at this point and the arm is extending</text><text start="416.48" dur="5.58">towards the switch even once the arm</text><text start="420.23" dur="3.63">pulls away from the normally closed</text><text start="422.06" dur="4.23">momentary switch that&amp;#39;s inside its</text><text start="423.86" dur="4.29">housing the arm continues to move</text><text start="426.29" dur="4.53">forward so this is where you&amp;#39;ve gotten</text><text start="428.15" dur="4.47">the four input states in three output</text><text start="430.82" dur="5.01">states somewhere one of the output</text><text start="432.62" dur="5.52">States needs to be doubled so regardless</text><text start="435.83" dur="4.02">of the position of the momentary if the</text><text start="438.14" dur="3.81">double pole double throw toggle switch</text><text start="439.85" dur="3.93">is pushed in the correct direction the</text><text start="441.95" dur="4.74">arm is always going to be extending so</text><text start="443.78" dur="4.62">it plugs to states with one output once</text><text start="446.69" dur="5.37">the arm reaches the double pole double</text><text start="448.4" dur="6.15">throw switch and toggles it back the</text><text start="452.06" dur="5.16">polarity is reversed and the normally</text><text start="454.55" dur="4.41">closed momentary is closed which means</text><text start="457.22" dur="4.65">that the motor gets powered in reverse</text><text start="458.96" dur="5.97">and it keeps retracting until it rests</text><text start="461.87" dur="5.37">inside the housing and presses that</text><text start="464.93" dur="4.11">momentary switch at which point it stops</text><text start="467.24" dur="3.45">moving and re-enters the idle state</text><text start="469.04" dur="4.23">waiting for you to press the button</text><text start="470.69" dur="3.84">again effectively the only thing that I</text><text start="473.27" dur="4.32">did to make this circuit more</text><text start="474.53" dur="5.76">complicated is add a delay to the motor</text><text start="477.59" dur="4.47">so when the motor is powered forwards it</text><text start="480.29" dur="4.17">waits before turning on and when the</text><text start="482.06" dur="5.22">motor is powered backwards it goes</text><text start="484.46" dur="5.64">immediately and in parallel with this I</text><text start="487.28" dur="5.73">have the circuit that does the siren and</text><text start="490.1" dur="4.59">the siren circuit only turns on when the</text><text start="493.01" dur="2.76">motor is pushing outwards because of</text><text start="494.69" dur="2.7">course once you&amp;#39;ve pushed the switch</text><text start="495.77" dur="4.38">it&amp;#39;s time to stop panicking and the</text><text start="497.39" dur="6.63">siren turns off so the motor with</text><text start="500.15" dur="5.37">one-way delay is sort of a sub-module of</text><text start="504.02" dur="6.57">this whole circuit so I&amp;#39;m going to draw</text><text start="505.52" dur="8.31">it by itself it is quite loosely a 555</text><text start="510.59" dur="5.31">timer in monostable mode that is hooked</text><text start="513.83" dur="4.2">up so that it powers a motor in one</text><text start="515.9" dur="3.68">direction while that motor can run in</text><text start="518.03" dur="5.61">the other direction whenever it wants</text><text start="519.58" dur="6.34">you can see that as soon as the circuit</text><text start="523.64" dur="3.96">is powered in reverse the motor is</text><text start="525.92" dur="3.78">instantly driven backwards because</text><text start="527.6" dur="4.83">there&amp;#39;s a diode that allows the current</text><text start="529.7" dur="4.86">to bypass the entire timing circuit and</text><text start="532.43" dur="4.47">just go straight to the motor and this</text><text start="534.56" dur="3.4">is important because as soon as the</text><text start="536.9" dur="4.09">robotic arm</text><text start="537.96" dur="4.62">the switch we want the arm to retract we</text><text start="540.99" dur="3.36">don&amp;#39;t want it to wait before retracting</text><text start="542.58" dur="4.56">so it&amp;#39;s got to be powered immediately</text><text start="544.35" dur="6.15">the delay only happens when the system</text><text start="547.14" dur="6">is powered forward when the system is</text><text start="550.5" dur="6.51">powered in the forward direction you can</text><text start="553.14" dur="5.49">see that that diode no longer allows</text><text start="557.01" dur="4.53">current to flow through the motor in</text><text start="558.63" dur="5.01">fact it prevents it so instead the</text><text start="561.54" dur="4.53">current to the motor needs to flow</text><text start="563.64" dur="6.06">through a transistor and that transistor</text><text start="566.07" dur="6.87">is only turned on when the 555 tells it</text><text start="569.7" dur="5.88">that it&amp;#39;s time at this point the 555</text><text start="572.94" dur="4.41">timer is in a regular monostable mode</text><text start="575.58" dur="3.96">because it&amp;#39;s being powered in the</text><text start="577.35" dur="4.95">forward direction the way it should be</text><text start="579.54" dur="4.71">and you have to wait for the capacitor</text><text start="582.3" dur="6.39">to charge and once the capacitor charges</text><text start="584.25" dur="7.23">the output pin of the 555 pin 3 drops</text><text start="588.69" dur="5.94">low which turns on the transistor that</text><text start="591.48" dur="4.92">powers the motor so in reverse bias the</text><text start="594.63" dur="4.38">motor goes immediately but in for bias</text><text start="596.4" dur="5.49">it has to wait for that monostable 555</text><text start="599.01" dur="7.5">to let it go the one way siren circuit</text><text start="601.89" dur="6.72">is a lot easier it&amp;#39;s basically 2555</text><text start="606.51" dur="4.8">timers one of which controls the</text><text start="608.61" dur="5.73">blinking lights and one of its controls</text><text start="611.31" dur="5.28">the buzzer and they can only run in one</text><text start="614.34" dur="3.77">direction because the positive and</text><text start="616.59" dur="4.83">negative rails that the circuit are</text><text start="618.11" dur="4.99">controlled by a single diode so current</text><text start="621.42" dur="4.44">just can&amp;#39;t flow the other way that&amp;#39;s why</text><text start="623.1" dur="4.2">it only turns on in forward bias the</text><text start="625.86" dur="3.3">most interesting thing about this</text><text start="627.3" dur="3.87">circuit is that the buzzer actually</text><text start="629.16" dur="4.11">changes frequency and it changes</text><text start="631.17" dur="4.47">frequency in time with the lights so</text><text start="633.27" dur="4.41">when the lights blink on and off the</text><text start="635.64" dur="3.18">buzzer is actually switching from high</text><text start="637.68" dur="3">frequency to low frequency high</text><text start="638.82" dur="3.63">frequency low frequency so the buzzers</text><text start="640.68" dur="4.62">just not going on and off it&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="642.45" dur="5.55">sounding like a siren this is</text><text start="645.3" dur="5.49">accomplished by taking the trigger and</text><text start="648" dur="4.59">threshold pins that are on the positive</text><text start="650.79" dur="4.05">side of the timing capacitor of the</text><text start="652.59" dur="5.25">blinker circuit and routing that</text><text start="654.84" dur="5.94">directly into the control voltage pin of</text><text start="657.84" dur="6.54">the second 555 timer that controls the</text><text start="660.78" dur="6.24">buzzer so the frequency of the buzzer is</text><text start="664.38"
