dur="3.439">representative to go to the jungle</text><text start="8.559" dur="4.16">council which makes laws for the kingdom</text><text start="10.559" dur="4.401">but her citizens are unhappy and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="12.719" dur="4.001">easy to see why the council is full of</text><text start="14.96" dur="3.84">monkeys of course some of her citizens</text><text start="16.72" dur="4.08">are monkeys but not all of them this</text><text start="18.8" dur="3.76">council doesn&amp;#39;t fairly represent her</text><text start="20.8" dur="3.68">kingdom queenline visits one of the</text><text start="22.56" dur="4.08">ranges to find out what&amp;#39;s wrong and how</text><text start="24.48" dur="4.959">to fix it in this range there are five</text><text start="26.64" dur="4.799">monkeys four tigers three owls two links</text><text start="29.439" dur="4.161">and one buffalo one of each runs for</text><text start="31.439" dur="4.081">representative and all citizens vote for</text><text start="33.6" dur="3.44">their own species the election rule is</text><text start="35.52" dur="3.6">that the candidate with the most votes</text><text start="37.04" dur="4">wins which is the monkey but it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="39.12" dur="3.759">pretty unsatisfying result considering</text><text start="41.04" dur="3.839">that two-thirds of the citizens in this</text><text start="42.879" dur="3.84">range aren&amp;#39;t monkeys and wouldn&amp;#39;t vote</text><text start="44.879" dur="3.68">for monkeys this is the same across all</text><text start="46.719" dur="3.68">the ranges of the kingdom the monkeys</text><text start="48.559" dur="3.68">always happen to have more votes than</text><text start="50.399" dur="4">anybody else so they win all the</text><text start="52.239" dur="3.921">elections even though they&amp;#39;re a minority</text><text start="54.399" dur="4.881">of the total population closer</text><text start="56.16" dur="3.12">inspection reveals that the</text><text start="70.96" dur="3.839">of citizens happy available the election</text><text start="72.56" dur="4.32">results one way to do that is to abolish</text><text start="74.799" dur="3.841">the ranges and use a proportional system</text><text start="76.88" dur="3.68">but her citizens want local</text><text start="78.64" dur="3.519">representatives so queen line needs a</text><text start="80.56" dur="3.52">system that both makes her citizens</text><text start="82.159" dur="3.761">happier by having a more representative</text><text start="84.08" dur="3.76">council while keeping the local</text><text start="85.92" dur="4.239">elections in place after doing a little</text><text start="87.84" dur="4.319">research she finds out how single</text><text start="90.159" dur="4.241">transferable votes the big change with</text><text start="92.159" dur="4.481">stv is that ranges send more than one</text><text start="94.4" dur="4.32">representative which may seem weird but</text><text start="96.64" dur="3.92">queen line decides to test it out she</text><text start="98.72" dur="3.679">takes three ranges which used to each</text><text start="100.56" dur="3.839">send one representative and combines</text><text start="102.399" dur="4.08">them into one bigger range that will</text><text start="104.399" dur="4">send three on election day citizens go</text><text start="106.479" dur="4.241">to the polls and the results in this new</text><text start="108.399" dur="4.641">range are just the same as they were in</text><text start="110.72" dur="4.399">the old ranges so nothing seems better</text><text start="113.04" dur="4.16">but with stv to figure out the winners</text><text start="115.119" dur="4.241">take the total votes and divide them by</text><text start="117.2" dur="5.519">the number of representatives needed in</text><text start="119.36" dur="5.759">this case 3 which gives 33 as the amount</text><text start="122.719" dur="4.08">a candidate needs to win so all three</text><text start="125.119" dur="3.601">candidates go to the council which</text><text start="126.799" dur="4.08">accurately represents the citizens in</text><text start="128.72" dur="4.159">the range whereas under the old system</text><text start="130.879" dur="3.521">each individual range would have sent a</text><text start="132.879" dur="3.761">monkey leaving two-thirds of the</text><text start="134.4" dur="4.16">citizens without representation a bigger</text><text start="136.64" dur="3.84">range with multiple winners allows the</text><text start="138.56" dur="3.92">results to be more proportional this</text><text start="140.48" dur="4.24">test turned out well but it was also as</text><text start="142.48" dur="4.08">simple as could be now queen line wants</text><text start="144.72" dur="3.68">to see what happens in a race where not</text><text start="146.56" dur="3.679">everybody is a winner the next big range</text><text start="148.4" dur="4.8">she tests has five candidates running</text><text start="150.239" dur="4.561">for office gorilla tarsier monkey tiger</text><text start="153.2" dur="3.679">and lynx three of which can be</text><text start="154.8" dur="3.76">representatives election day comes and</text><text start="156.879" dur="4.161">goes and here are the results of the</text><text start="158.56" dur="4.56">citizens first choices tarsier gets five</text><text start="161.04" dur="5.199">percent gorilla gets 28</text><text start="163.12" dur="6.32">monkey gets 33 tiger gets 21 and links</text><text start="166.239" dur="5.601">gets 13. as before a candidate needs 33</text><text start="169.44" dur="4.32">percent to win monkey has that and so is</text><text start="171.84" dur="3.84">immediately selected as one of the three</text><text start="173.76" dur="4.32">representatives but no one else reached</text><text start="175.68" dur="4.72">the winning 33 so how are the other two</text><text start="178.08" dur="4.48">representatives selected step one get</text><text start="180.4" dur="4">rid of the biggest loser sorry tarsier</text><text start="182.56" dur="3.599">you really had no chance at all when the</text><text start="184.4" dur="3.52">citizens voted they could have just put</text><text start="186.159" dur="4.641">an x next to the candidate they liked</text><text start="187.92" dur="4.64">best but with stv they can also rank</text><text start="190.8" dur="3.359">their favorite candidates this is</text><text start="192.56" dur="3.759">important because it shows how the</text><text start="194.159" dur="4.08">election would have turned out if one of</text><text start="196.319" dur="3.92">the candidates hadn&amp;#39;t run tiny and</text><text start="198.239" dur="4.321">worried tarsiers would have voted for</text><text start="200.239" dur="4.881">the big calm gorilla without tarsier in</text><text start="202.56" dur="4.08">the race so if their candidate can&amp;#39;t win</text><text start="205.12" dur="3.759">they want their votes to go to the</text><text start="206.64" dur="4.56">gorilla instead this pushes gorilla up</text><text start="208.879" dur="4.241">to 33 percent and he becomes the next</text><text start="211.2" dur="3.28">representative ranking allows citizens</text><text start="213.12" dur="3.119">to support their favorite candidate</text><text start="214.48" dur="3.52">without worrying there&amp;#39;s no point in</text><text start="216.239" dur="3.441">strategizing about how everyone else is</text><text start="218" dur="3.84">going to vote the system works to</text><text start="219.68" dur="3.68">maximize voter happiness with the result</text><text start="221.84" dur="3.2">now back to the range there&amp;#39;s still one</text><text start="223.36" dur="3.599">representative to select so the next</text><text start="225.04" dur="3.759">biggest loser is links his voters don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="226.959" dur="3.441">like simeons but they do think tiger&amp;#39;s</text><text start="228.799" dur="3.52">interests are similar to theirs and so</text><text start="230.4" dur="4.399">if links can&amp;#39;t win they want tiger to</text><text start="232.319" dur="3.92">get their votes he reaches 33 and</text><text start="234.799" dur="3.201">becomes the third and final</text><text start="236.239" dur="3.36">representative the election results look</text><text start="238" dur="4">pretty good especially considering the</text><text start="239.599" dur="4.081">citizens first and second choices now</text><text start="242" dur="3.439">more citizens also have a local</text><text start="243.68" dur="4">representative they can feel comfortable</text><text start="245.439" dur="4.321">approaching whereas using the old system</text><text start="247.68" dur="3.6">everybody gets a monkey lastly queen</text><text start="249.76" dur="3.44">line wants to know what happens in a</text><text start="251.28" dur="3.76">range with just two political parties</text><text start="253.2" dur="3.599">under the most votes win system multiple</text><text start="255.04" dur="4">candidates from the same party would be</text><text start="256.799" dur="4.241">a disaster they&amp;#39;d split their voters and</text><text start="259.04" dur="3.599">hand the win to their opposition queen</text><text start="261.04" dur="3.84">line makes one last test range with</text><text start="262.639" dur="4.081">two-thirds tigers and one-third gorillas</text><text start="264.88" dur="3.759">that&amp;#39;s as before needs three</text><text start="266.72" dur="4.24">representatives because citizens rank</text><text start="268.639" dur="4.081">their candidates under stv there can be</text><text start="270.96" dur="4.08">more than one candidate from the same</text><text start="272.72" dur="4.479">party running at the same time without</text><text start="275.04" dur="4.24">any problems the tigers run two</text><text start="277.199" dur="4">candidates as do the guerrillas on</text><text start="279.28" dur="3.84">election day white tiger gets a massive</text><text start="281.199" dur="4.161">amount of first choice votes probably</text><text start="283.12" dur="4.24">because he&amp;#39;s so cool meanwhile the</text><text start="285.36" dur="3.839">gorillas are split between their new guy</text><text start="287.36" dur="3.92">and the old silverback white tiger is</text><text start="289.199" dur="4.241">selected as the first representative but</text><text start="291.28" dur="3.76">what happens next while tiger is the</text><text start="293.44" dur="3.52">biggest loser and it seems like he</text><text start="295.04" dur="3.76">should be eliminated it&amp;#39;s also obvious</text><text start="296.96" dur="4.239">that he would have gotten way more votes</text><text start="298.8" dur="4.48">if white tiger wasn&amp;#39;t in the race if a</text><text start="301.199" dur="4.401">candidate has more votes than they need</text><text start="303.28" dur="4.639">like white tiger does the first step is</text><text start="305.6" dur="4.879">to give the extra votes to their second</text><text start="307.919" dur="4.481">choice this gets tiger to 33</text><text start="310.479" dur="3.44">and he becomes the next representative</text><text start="312.4" dur="3.44">if that seems strange there are two</text><text start="313.919" dur="3.761">things to consider if instead the extra</text><text start="315.84" dur="2.96">votes were ignored and tiger eliminated</text><text start="317.68" dur="3.28">then the gorillas would get the</text><text start="318.8" dur="4.48">remaining two wins which would obviously</text><text start="320.96" dur="4.4">not be representing the range very well</text><text start="323.28" dur="4.24">and ignoring extra votes punishes</text><text start="325.36" dur="3.92">citizens who back popular candidates</text><text start="327.52" dur="3.92">which gets us back to the problem where</text><text start="329.28" dur="3.759">voters start thinking about how everyone</text><text start="331.44" dur="3.599">else will vote rather than what they</text><text start="333.039" dur="3.841">really want if a candidate is able to</text><text start="335.039" dur="4">get more votes than they really need</text><text start="336.88" dur="4.48">then it also means those who support him</text><text start="339.039" dur="3.921">are a big section of the population and</text><text start="341.36" dur="4">thus fairly should get more</text><text start="342.96" dur="4.4">representation right after the extra</text><text start="345.36" dur="4.399">votes go to tiger the election finishes</text><text start="347.36" dur="4.24">as before silverback came in last is</text><text start="349.759" dur="3.921">eliminated and his voters second choice</text><text start="351.6" dur="4.56">is the younger candidate so gorilla gets</text><text start="353.68" dur="4.799">in and the results look fair queen lion</text><text start="356.16" dur="4.319">has seen stv work whether a range has</text><text start="358.479" dur="4.321">one party or lots of parties the process</text><text start="360.479" dur="4.241">is still always the same first citizens</text><text start="362.8" dur="3.679">rank their favorite candidates second</text><text start="364.72" dur="4">any candidate above the threshold wins</text><text start="366.479" dur="4.16">immediately extra votes then go to their</text><text start="368.72" dur="3.52">next choice if there&amp;#39;s no winner the</text><text start="370.639" dur="4.241">last place is eliminated and the votes</text><text start="372.24" dur="4.959">go to their next choice repeat until all</text><text start="374.88" dur="4.319">the winners are found this whole process</text><text start="377.199" dur="4.161">is designed to maximize the number of</text><text start="379.199" dur="4.72">citizens who are happy with the results</text><text start="381.36" dur="5.04">and it gives stv many advantages over</text><text start="383.919" dur="3.84">the old most votes win system citizens</text><text start="386.4" dur="2.72">can honestly vote for their favorite</text><text start="387.759" dur="3.361">candidate without worrying about what</text><text start="389.12" dur="3.6">everyone else is going to do it&amp;#39;s more</text><text start="391.12" dur="4.079">proportional so monkeying with the</text><text start="392.72" dur="3.759">borders matters less and almost all</text><text start="395.199" dur="3.761">citizens will have a local</text><text start="396.479" dur="4.241">representative they actually voted for</text><text start="398.96" dur="3.28">in the end queen line decides to switch</text><text start="400.72" dur="3.44">the
