to build a one-match fire and</text><text start="14.46" dur="3.6">even the worst condition and it looks</text><text start="16.83" dur="3.89">like we&amp;#39;re going to get a chance to do</text><text start="18.06" dur="5.58">just that because it&amp;#39;s starting to rain</text><text start="20.72" dur="7.719">all right let&amp;#39;s get our jackets on you</text><text start="23.64" dur="14.88">got

it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="39.989" dur="7.98">raining enough let me go film the fire</text><text start="44.75" dur="5.14">all right buddy all right the key to</text><text start="47.969" dur="4.11">building a fire in the rain is having</text><text start="49.89" dur="3.899">two to three times more kindling and</text><text start="52.079" dur="4.14">tinder than you would normally use you</text><text start="53.789" dur="5.131">really cannot overdo this it&amp;#39;s not going</text><text start="56.219" dur="4.59">to be dry so get lots and lots of it the</text><text start="58.92" dur="3.81">finer the better also you&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="60.809" dur="5.1">need some sort of shelter to light that</text><text start="62.73" dur="5.31">match your tinder has to be 100% dry or</text><text start="65.909" dur="3.901">it&amp;#39;s just not going to work in wet</text><text start="68.04" dur="3.63">conditions one of my favorite tenders is</text><text start="69.81" dur="3.84">wood shavings and you can get dry wood</text><text start="71.67" dur="3.87">shavings from a wet piece of wood as</text><text start="73.65" dur="4.62">long as you can keep the rain off your</text><text start="75.54" dur="5.369">shavings in this condition however it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="78.27" dur="5.22">just you know an uphill battle the rain</text><text start="80.909" dur="5.131">splashing around the lid the humidity so</text><text start="83.49" dur="4.44">high it&amp;#39;s just just not working</text><text start="86.04" dur="4.439">additionally the fire pit is filling up</text><text start="87.93" dur="4.02">with water so I&amp;#39;m having to make sure I</text><text start="90.479" dur="4.32">get the water out of the bottom of the</text><text start="91.95" dur="5.489">fire power pit so in this situation I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="94.799" dur="4.561">going to use a bag of dry shaving I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="97.439" dur="4.161">going to slip it under the shelter I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="99.36" dur="5.009">going to pile up all my kindling and</text><text start="101.6" dur="5.29">fine stuff on top of it and that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="104.369" dur="4.771">very last-minute possible I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="106.89" dur="4.83">open up the bag and I&amp;#39;m going to light</text><text start="109.14" dur="4.2">the tinder inside the bag I&amp;#39;m not going</text><text start="111.72" dur="4.32">to take it out because it will get wet</text><text start="113.34" dur="5.459">once that bag is burned up and the</text><text start="116.04" dur="4.859">tinder is starting to ignite then I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="118.799" dur="4.081">going to start piling as much kindling</text><text start="120.899" dur="5.01">as I can on top of this thing I am going</text><text start="122.88" dur="5.189">to absolutely smother this fire and then</text><text start="125.909" dur="5.631">what I&amp;#39;m going to do is just fan it</text><text start="128.069" dur="7.191">religiously just whatever blowing or you</text><text start="131.54" dur="5.82">that&amp;#39;s been lid do something to pump as</text><text start="135.26" dur="3.929">much oxygen in there if you can&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="137.36" dur="3.93">dry conditions at least give that fire</text><text start="139.189" dur="3.901">loads of oxygen and what you&amp;#39;re doing is</text><text start="141.29" dur="3.509">by piling huge amounts of kindling on</text><text start="143.09" dur="3.209">top of the fire you&amp;#39;re making a little</text><text start="144.799" dur="3.481">bit of shelter from the rain you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="146.299" dur="4.621">keeping the flame a little bit more</text><text start="148.28" dur="3.9">isolated from the water and you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="150.92" dur="3.12">giving that wood more of an opportunity</text><text start="152.18" dur="4.26">to dry out but unfortunately this</text><text start="154.04" dur="3.96">smothers the fire so you have to fan it</text><text start="156.44" dur="3.629">to compensate for that lack of office</text><text start="158" dur="5.64">remember this isn&amp;#39;t a sprint it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="160.069" dur="7.26">marathon so slow and steady wins race</text><text start="163.64" dur="6.03">don&amp;#39;t have to do this okay just keep</text><text start="167.329" dur="4.621">piling on more wood piling on more wood</text><text start="169.67" dur="4.83">and try to make a little bit of a</text><text start="171.95" dur="4.83">shelter or by putting the logs on top</text><text start="174.5" dur="4.65">we&amp;#39;re leaning the logs against the side</text><text start="176.78" dur="4.59">and that will help dry out the wood</text><text start="179.15" dur="5.1">before it has a chance to burn and it&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="181.37" dur="5.25">keep the rain off the coals and it can</text><text start="184.25" dur="5.31">get really really crazy but as long as</text><text start="186.62" dur="5.72">you do this you can build a fire even in</text><text start="189.56" dur="2.78">the worst condition</text><text start="197.07" dur="5.9">[Music]</text><text start="199.22" dur="4.98">who didn&amp;#39;t sale is going to be easy but</text><text start="202.97" dur="6.27">that&amp;#39;s how you build a one-match fire</text><text start="204.2" dur="6.48">and even the worst condition just double</text><text start="209.24" dur="3.57">and triple amount of tinder you use</text><text start="210.68" dur="4.14">double and triple amount of kindling you</text><text start="212.81" dur="4.35">use and put a lot of elbow grease into</text><text start="214.82" dur="4.05">family milk
