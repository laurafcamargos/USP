start="76.27" dur="9.44">successful what is their altruism and</text><text start="82.44" dur="6.429">colony organization</text><text start="85.71" dur="6.43">what is this unique or special about</text><text start="88.869" dur="7.591">that that makes them the equivalent of</text><text start="92.14" dur="7.68">humans among all other animals and the</text><text start="96.46" dur="6.78">answer to that is first of all they&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="99.82" dur="7.799">had a long time as a group of organisms</text><text start="103.24" dur="7.53">in which to by evolution

the</text><text start="126.91" dur="7.65">ants have perfected colonial</text><text start="129.97" dur="8.9">organization based upon altruism and it</text><text start="134.56" dur="7.35">is in altruism and the peculiarities of</text><text start="138.87" dur="7.449">social organization in the ants that</text><text start="141.91" dur="6.78">scientists turned in order to learn more</text><text

of group</text><text start="156.67" dur="7.47">selection recently I tracked through the</text><text start="161.53" dur="6.87">whole history of life and through fossil</text><text start="164.14"

dur="6.781">there&amp;#39;s at least 17 times and one of</text><text start="190.269" dur="6.411">those times humans</text><text start="192.49" dur="8.13">or another and ants have clearly</text><text start="196.68" dur="6.13">advanced to that level because they come</text><text start="200.62" dur="6.57">from groups with insects that tend to</text><text start="202.81" dur="8.37">form groups anyway there are and</text><text start="207.19" dur="7.94">societies and at first the stages were</text><text start="211.18" dur="9.27">very pretty but then as the groups</text><text start="215.13" dur="8.88">competed with other groups the form of</text><text start="220.45" dur="8.49">the cooperation became more intense and</text><text start="224.01" dur="9.03">and more varied and complicated and ants</text><text start="228.94" dur="6.42">developed true alkyl altruism in which</text><text start="233.04" dur="5.71">individual ant workers sacrificed</text><text start="235.36"
