dur="3.159">remember coming back at the end of each</text><text start="168.76" dur="3.08">of those Summers and thinking man you</text><text start="170.599" dur="4.441">know what I really want to do with my</text><text start="171.84" dur="4.36">life is spend more time doing math so I</text><text start="175.04" dur="3.8">had a passion I had something I would</text><text start="176.2" dur="4.679">want to follow but in hindsight that</text><text start="178.84" dur="3.479">passion was a lot more more arbitrary</text><text start="180.879" dur="2.841">and maybe a little more

start="186.959" dur="3.64">honest I think it had its roots in the</text><text start="188.4" dur="3.759">fact that when I was young the adults</text><text start="190.599" dur="3.481">emphasized this is an important topic to</text><text start="192.159" dur="3.36">learn and they told me I was good at it</text><text start="194.08" dur="3">this makes me spend more time with it</text><text

you&amp;#39;re a</text><text start="232.4" dur="4.64">student the fundamental goal is to grow</text><text start="234.599" dur="4.241">to learn to become better so many</text><text start="237.04"

fact</text><text start="579.399" dur="4.721">that I was following a dream pursuing a</text><text start="581.72" dur="3.88">passion passion plays into it you can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="584.12" dur="3.159">have good lessons without a teacher who</text><text start="585.6" dur="4">cares but we can&amp;#39;t ignore the other</text><text start="587.279" dur="4.081">factors at play I already brought up the</text><text start="589.6" dur="3.96">biggest one success is a function of the</text><text start="591.36" dur="3.8">value you bring to others so a pursue</text><text start="593.56" dur="4">equally fueled by love but which did</text><text start="595.16" dur="4.64">nothing to help or to entertain people</text><text start="597.56" dur="4.64">just wouldn&amp;#39;t have had a chance to work</text><text start="599.8" dur="4.76">but another factor I want to focus on is</text><text start="602.2" dur="4.56">how I was very lucky with the timing if</text><text start="604.56" dur="3.08">I had been born 10 years earlier I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="606.76" dur="2.48">think I could have reached the same</text><text start="607.64" dur="4.6">number of people posting lessons on a</text><text start="609.24" dur="4.32">much more infant version of the internet</text><text start="612.24" dur="3.279">where there was less infrastructure that</text><text start="613.56" dur="4.44">could have existed to help form a career</text><text start="615.519" dur="4.081">doing so if I had started 10 years later</text><text start="618" dur="3.76">the space would have been a lot more</text><text start="619.6" dur="3.919">saturated so another piece of advice</text><text start="621.76" dur="3">that I&amp;#39;d like to offer another little</text><text start="623.519" dur="3.361">ingredient that makes following your</text><text start="624.76" dur="4.72">dreams a little more likely to work out</text><text start="626.88" dur="4.72">is to ask yourself what&amp;#39;s possible now</text><text start="629.48" dur="4.88">that wasn&amp;#39;t possible 10 years ago and</text><text start="631.6" dur="4.2">which might get harder 10 years from now</text><text start="634.36" dur="3.32">there are more opportunities in a less</text><text start="635.8" dur="4.36">crowded landscape there are more chances</text><text start="637.68" dur="4.719">to grow if you&amp;#39;re part of a rising tide</text><text start="640.16" dur="4.04">but this requires pushing past the</text><text start="642.399" dur="4.44">inevitable discomfort that comes from</text><text start="644.2" dur="4.48">following a path that has little to no</text><text start="646.839" dur="4.041">precedent now next I want to take a</text><text start="648.68" dur="4.04">moment to talk about whose dreams you</text><text start="650.88" dur="3.959">should be thinking about because it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="652.72" dur="4.32">not just your own when I was visiting</text><text start="654.839" dur="3.56">Harvey mud last year I had the pleasure</text><text start="657.04" dur="3.76">of talking to one of the gems in your</text><text start="658.399" dur="4.401">math department to leave Williams and I</text><text start="660.8" dur="4.2">asked her hey what made you pursue math</text><text start="662.8" dur="3.719">in the first place she had a very clear</text><text start="665" dur="3.56">story she told me she hadn&amp;#39;t thought</text><text start="666.519" dur="3.801">about it very much until one distinct</text><text start="668.56" dur="3.8">day in her High School Calculus class</text><text start="670.32" dur="5.079">her teacher Mr Dorman pulled her aside</text><text start="672.36" dur="5.12">and said toia you&amp;#39;re really good at this</text><text start="675.399" dur="3.44">you should consider majoring in math</text><text start="677.48" dur="3">evidently she had never thought about it</text><text start="678.839" dur="3.321">before but that one comment was enough</text><text start="680.48" dur="4.08">to knock over the first in a series of</text><text start="682.16" dur="4.88">dominoes that led to a very flourishing</text><text start="684.56" dur="3.88">career in the topic over the years I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="687.04" dur="2.88">asked a lot of mathematicians the same</text><text start="688.44" dur="3.68">question and you would be shocked how</text><text start="689.92" dur="4.76">often I hear a very similar answer there</text><text start="692.12" dur="4.56">was this one particular teacher and one</text><text start="694.68" dur="3.36">seemingly simple thing that they did</text><text start="696.68" dur="2.52">that was the beginning in a long series</text><text start="698.04" dur="3.96">of</text><text start="699.2" dur="4.24">encouragements never underestimate just</text><text start="702" dur="3.399">how much influence you can have on</text><text start="703.44" dur="5.079">others especially the ones who are</text><text start="705.399" dur="4.961">younger than you are growing older is a</text><text start="708.519" dur="3.641">process of slowly seeing the proportion</text><text start="710.36" dur="6.64">of people around you who are younger</text><text start="712.16" dur="4.84">than you are rise inexorably closer to</text><text start="717.079" dur="5.161">100% as this happens you stand to have</text><text start="720.44" dur="3.72">as much influence by shaping the dreams</text><text start="722.24" dur="4.44">of those behind you as you do by</text><text start="724.16" dur="4.919">following those of your own and as a</text><text start="726.68" dur="4.44">very last point the biggest risk in the</text><text start="729.079" dur="4.361">follow your dreams cliche is the</text><text start="731.12" dur="7.24">implication that there&amp;#39;s one static</text><text start="733.44" dur="7.16">Target point at all in the next 10 20 30</text><text start="738.36" dur="4.24">years the world around you is going to</text><text start="740.6" dur="3.12">change a lot and those changes are going</text><text start="742.6" dur="3.239">to be</text><text start="743.72" dur="3.679">unpredictable I hardly need to emphasize</text><text start="745.839" dur="2.841">this point you are the class who spent</text><text start="747.399" dur="4.921">your formative transition from high</text><text start="748.68" dur="5.76">school to colge College under a pandemic</text><text start="752.32" dur="3.36">but it&amp;#39;s not just the world around you</text><text start="754.44" dur="3">tonight when you&amp;#39;re celebrating your</text><text start="755.68" dur="4.12">graduation and hopefully remembering to</text><text start="757.44" dur="3.759">celebrate Mother&amp;#39;s day as well take a</text><text start="759.8" dur="3.88">few moments to ask the people who are</text><text start="761.199" dur="3.88">older than you how they&amp;#39;ve changed how</text><text start="763.68" dur="4.159">their personalities how their value</text><text start="765.079" dur="4.961">systems have changed since they were a</text><text start="767.839" dur="4.56">student you&amp;#39;ll notice that essentially</text><text start="770.04" dur="3.84">all of them has an answer which suggests</text><text start="772.399" dur="2.24">you have every reason to expect that</text><text start="773.88" dur="2.519">there&amp;#39;s going to be something</text><text start="774.639" dur="3.681">fundamental about you that changes as</text><text start="776.399" dur="3.44">well in the coming decades probably</text><text start="778.32" dur="3.6">unpredictably</text><text start="779.839" dur="4.921">almost everyone I know has undergone</text><text start="781.92" dur="4.599">some kind of shift since College some</text><text start="784.76" dur="4.6">came to place more value on having a</text><text start="786.519" dur="4.641">family than they used to some shifted</text><text start="789.36" dur="3.479">from a trajectory that was oriented</text><text start="791.16" dur="3.6">towards an academic career to going into</text><text start="792.839" dur="3.521">industry some went the other way around</text><text start="794.76" dur="3.96">and after spending some time in Industry</text><text start="796.36" dur="4.76">returned to grad school and so so many</text><text start="798.72" dur="4.08">of them have jobs that simply didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="801.12" dur="4.24">exist at the time of their</text><text start="802.8" dur="5.12">graduation so rather than having any one</text><text start="805.36" dur="3.88">particular goal that defines who you are</text><text start="807.92" dur="3.56">you&amp;#39;ll take better advantage of of</text><text start="809.24" dur="4.44">whatever the future has to offer you if</text><text start="811.48" dur="4.2">you remain Nimble and if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="813.68" dur="4.159">responsive to the changes in the world</text><text start="815.68" dur="5.04">and if you anticipate change within</text><text start="817.839" dur="5.24">yourself my final piece of advice is to</text><text start="820.72" dur="4.32">not treat passion as something to follow</text><text start="823.079" dur="4.241">think of it as an initial velocity</text><text start="825.04" dur="4.359">Vector it gives a clear direction to</text><text start="827.32" dur="4.28">point yourself and loving what you do</text><text start="829.399" dur="3.961">can have you move quickly but you should</text><text start="831.6" dur="3.479">expect and you should even hope that the</text><text start="833.36" dur="3.32">specific direction that you&amp;#39;re moving</text><text start="835.079" dur="2.721">changes based on the force factors</text><text start="836.68" dur="3.76">around</text><text start="837.8" dur="4.479">you now these unpredictable decades that</text><text start="840.44" dur="3.639">come your generation is the one that</text><text start="842.279" dur="4.641">holds more sway than any other over how</text><text start="844.079" dur="5">it unfolds and you the graduating class</text><text start="846.92" dur="4.719">of Harvey mud represent some of the most</text><text start="849.079" dur="4.921">talented and thoughtful Minds in that</text><text start="851.639" dur="4.88">generation influence is not distributed</text><text start="854" dur="4.519">uniformly in the population and I for</text><text start="856.519" dur="4.161">one would feel a lot more
