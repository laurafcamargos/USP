dur="3.241">Pluto you may have noticed that I said</text><text start="4.319" dur="4.161">aloud the names of every planet except</text><text start="6.16" dur="4.04">one this one and that was no accident</text><text start="8.48" dur="3.239">but rather the result of careful script</text><text start="10.2" dur="2.68">editing because where I grew up I</text><text start="11.719" dur="3.641">learned that the name of the seventh</text><text start="12.88" dur="4.72">planet is pronounced Uranus of course to</text><text start="15.36" dur="4.56">a kid Uranus sounds an awful lot like</text><text start="17.6" dur="4.36">Uranus which is how I and everyone else</text><text start="19.92" dur="3.56">I knew ended up saying the name which is</text><text start="21.96" dur="2.92">funny when you&amp;#39;re a child but becomes</text><text start="23.48" dur="3.28">bit of a problem when you grow up and</text><text start="24.88" dur="4.36">try to teach scientific facts about the</text><text start="26.76" dur="4.2">planet for example Uranus has a ring</text><text start="29.24" dur="4.24">around it a astronomers have discovered</text><text start="30.96" dur="5.439">a Dark Spot on Uranus Uranus is a gas</text><text start="33.48" dur="4.48">giant Uranus is surrounded by methane</text><text start="36.399" dur="3.041">there is a solution to this problem the</text><text start="37.96" dur="4.24">alternative pronunciation of the name</text><text start="39.44" dur="4.88">which goes Uranus and most scientists in</text><text start="42.2" dur="4.519">public roles do use this pronunciation</text><text start="44.32" dur="4.2">but for me Uranus is still problematic</text><text start="46.719" dur="4.041">sure it&amp;#39;s better than Uranus but it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="48.52" dur="3.719">still Uranus and perhaps I&amp;#39;m just</text><text start="50.76" dur="3.88">childish but when someone else says</text><text start="52.239" dur="3.921">Uranus I still hear Uranus in my head</text><text start="54.64" dur="3.559">and it just draws more attention to the</text><text start="56.16" dur="4.359">unfortunate name the tragedy is it</text><text start="58.199" dur="3.801">didn&amp;#39;t have to be this way the seventh</text><text start="60.519" dur="3.6">planet from the sun is unique because</text><text start="62" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s the first planet we discovered for</text><text start="64.119" dur="3.161">all of human history the six closest</text><text start="65.72" dur="4.039">planets were big enough or bright enough</text><text start="67.28" dur="4.24">to see with just our limited Simeon eyes</text><text start="69.759" dur="3.4">but the next planet was too dim to see</text><text start="71.52" dur="3.2">until our telescope technology got good</text><text start="73.159" dur="3.241">enough for British astronomer William</text><text start="74.72" dur="3.52">pel to spot it in</text><text start="76.4" dur="3.44">1781 understandably though he didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="78.24" dur="3.36">think he discovered a new planet since</text><text start="79.84" dur="3.8">from the rise of modern humans 50,000</text><text start="81.6" dur="4.519">years earlier until that Tuesday no one</text><text start="83.64" dur="4.64">ever had but Discover it he did and so</text><text start="86.119" dur="3.481">choose a name he must and hersel being</text><text start="88.28" dur="2.879">the good subject of the crown that he</text><text start="89.6" dur="3.6">was christened his new planet the</text><text start="91.159" dur="4.24">georgium cus which means the Georgian</text><text start="93.2" dur="4.48">star and the George in that Georgian</text><text start="95.399" dur="4.36">star was King George III the reigning</text><text start="97.68" dur="3.52">monarch while King George liked the name</text><text start="99.759" dur="3.081">the rest of the world did not and</text><text start="101.2" dur="3.279">decided that perhaps hersel wasn&amp;#39;t the</text><text start="102.84" dur="3.44">best guy to name the new planet after</text><text start="104.479" dur="3.881">all and quickly decided to come up with</text><text start="106.28" dur="4.199">Alternatives of their own one suggestion</text><text start="108.36" dur="3.439">was Neptune which is confusing to us now</text><text start="110.479" dur="3.521">but at the time the planet that would</text><text start="111.799" dur="3.68">become Neptune had not yet been found a</text><text start="114" dur="3.039">more obvious alternative was to name the</text><text start="115.479" dur="3.361">planet hersel after the man who</text><text start="117.039" dur="3.641">discovered it even in Great Britain the</text><text start="118.84" dur="3.8">name of georgium cus proved a bit stuffy</text><text start="120.68" dur="4.24">for some so variants like the Georgian</text><text start="122.64" dur="4">planet or just georgium were also used</text><text start="124.92" dur="4.039">though never as you might have heard</text><text start="126.64" dur="3.759">George side note here while researching</text><text start="128.959" dur="2.841">this video I found a lot of websites</text><text start="130.399" dur="3.521">claiming that the seventh planet was</text><text start="131.8" dur="4.24">almost named George but I was never able</text><text start="133.92" dur="3.16">to find a primary source for this as</text><text start="136.04" dur="2.88">best I could tell searching through</text><text start="137.08" dur="3.64">documents from the time no one ever</text><text start="138.92" dur="4.2">suggested this name I checked with the</text><text start="140.72" dur="3.68">Royal Institution who since 1799 has</text><text start="143.12" dur="2.72">been promoting science Awesomeness from</text><text start="144.4" dur="3.08">the heart of London and whose videos you</text><text start="145.84" dur="3.16">should now go watch and they confirm the</text><text start="147.48" dur="3.24">name George was never on the table</text><text start="149" dur="2.84">because to so casually refer to the king</text><text start="150.72" dur="2.799">at the time would have been</text><text start="151.84" dur="4.32">disrespectful and disrespecting a</text><text start="153.519" dur="4.481">monarch is never a good idea especially</text><text start="156.16" dur="3.799">one who is slowly losing his mind from a</text><text start="158" dur="3.8">genetic disorder but that&amp;#39;s a story for</text><text start="159.959" dur="3.241">another time anyway another real</text><text start="161.8" dur="3.159">suggestion for the new planet&amp;#39;s name</text><text start="163.2" dur="3.84">came from Johan bod who suggested the</text><text start="164.959" dur="3.881">Greek god of the sky when a colleague of</text><text start="167.04" dur="4.24">bodess discovered the 92nd element in</text><text start="168.84" dur="5.039">1789 he named it uranium to support</text><text start="171.28" dur="4.16">bod&amp;#39;s choice and try and end the debate</text><text start="173.879" dur="2.841">perhaps because these two were German it</text><text start="175.44" dur="2.799">might not have occurred to them how the</text><text start="176.72" dur="3.56">word would eventually be corrupted in</text><text start="178.239" dur="4.161">English though it&amp;#39;s also hard to know</text><text start="180.28" dur="4.2">how English speakers in the 1780s and90s</text><text start="182.4" dur="3.96">would have pronounced the name but since</text><text start="184.48" dur="3.679">the word anus was in the language then</text><text start="186.36" dur="3.84">it seems unlikely that this particular</text><text start="188.159" dur="3.241">pronunciation would have been popular it</text><text start="190.2" dur="3.72">may also have been pronounced with a</text><text start="191.4" dur="4.88">flat a to sound like Uranus or something</text><text start="193.92" dur="3.84">more like the Greek name uranos these</text><text start="196.28" dur="4.12">names competed with each other over</text><text start="197.76" dur="4.44">decades for example still in 1823 the</text><text start="200.4" dur="4.199">Encyclopedia Britannica lists the planet</text><text start="202.2" dur="4.119">as herel notes the alternative names and</text><text start="204.599" dur="3.321">then proceeds to carefully word the rest</text><text start="206.319" dur="3.801">of the article to avoid naming the</text><text start="207.92" dur="3.8">planet again but you dear modern viewer</text><text start="210.12" dur="3.96">know that eventually these Alternatives</text><text start="211.72" dur="3.96">faded and left this name triumphant</text><text start="214.08" dur="3.359">which leaves someone like me with my</text><text start="215.68" dur="4.08">terrible pronunciation longing for</text><text start="217.439" dur="3.601">history to have taken a different path</text><text start="219.76" dur="2.72">the name hersel might have made the</text><text start="221.04" dur="2.64">planet sound a bit like a boring</text><text start="222.48" dur="3.28">accountant rather than the very</text><text start="223.68" dur="3.44">interesting Planet it actually is but</text><text start="225.76" dur="3.36">this would still be a much better name</text><text start="227.12" dur="3.88">than what we have Neptune is obviously a</text><text start="229.12" dur="3.6">fine planetary name though picking this</text><text start="231" dur="3.599">might have just delayed the problem</text><text start="232.72" dur="3.64">finally the georgium cus is a bit</text><text start="234.599" dur="3.161">awkward and in sillier moments I wish</text><text start="236.36" dur="3.48">that hersel had just been more direct</text><text start="237.76" dur="3.28">and named it King George because how fun</text><text start="239.84" dur="3.319">would that make it to teach kids the</text><text start="241.04" dur="4.399">list of planets today Mercury Venus</text><text start="243.159" dur="4.521">Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn King George</text><text start="245.439" dur="3.681">and Neptune in classroom such an unusual</text><text start="247.68" dur="3.16">name would change the planet from a</text><text start="249.12" dur="3.52">thing to a void to a starting point for</text><text start="250.84" dur="3.64">discussions about what makes that planet</text><text start="252.64" dur="3.8">different and how astronomy and our view</text><text start="254.48" dur="4.8">of the universe change and progress over</text><text start="256.44" dur="4.639">time but my practical dreams aside we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="259.28" dur="3.24">stuck with his name which for me means</text><text start="261.079" dur="3.801">choosing between the pronunciation which</text><text start="262.52" dur="4.52">comes naturally and is terrible or the</text><text start="264.88" dur="4.52">unnatural awkward one which is still</text><text start="267.04" dur="3.999">unsatisfactory so what&amp;#39;s a man to do in</text><text start="269.4" dur="3.44">the end probably follow the lead of the</text><text start="271.039" dur="3.801">Encyclopedia Britannica and avoid the</text><text start="272.84" dur="3.68">name when possible which is a sad fate</text><text start="274.84" dur="5.04">for the planet in our solar system with</text><text start="276.52" dur="3.36">such an interesting story to</text><text start="282.24" dur="7.48">tell Uranus Uranus</text><text start="286.56" dur="5.32">Uranus Uranus</text><text start="289.72" dur="3.64">Uranus seriously people could we at</text><text start="291.88" dur="3.72">least
