dur="5.84">the rain right after a computational</text><text start="36.52" dur="4.68">physics class so uh in that</text><text start="39.76" dur="3.84">computational physics class we were</text><text start="41.2" dur="5.679">using a lot of random sampling methods</text><text start="43.6" dur="6.56">markof chain weird uses for random walks</text><text start="46.879" dur="5.241">and weighted things walks in large</text><text start="50.16" dur="4.64">dimensional space and bizarre stuff like</text><text start="52.12" dur="6.04">that but you can calculate Things based</text><text start="54.8" dur="5.919">on random numbers if you have very high</text><text start="58.16" dur="5.52">quality random numbers to start with so</text><text start="60.719" dur="4.881">one day after class I was running and it</text><text start="63.68" dur="3.84">started to rain and I was noticing the</text><text start="65.6" dur="3.44">pattern of the raindrops on the ground</text><text start="67.52" dur="4.239">before the ground was completely</text><text start="69.04" dur="4.36">saturated and just how randomly the</text><text start="71.759" dur="3.4">droplets were distributed and how even</text><text start="73.4" dur="3.399">it was and thought man it would be</text><text start="75.159" dur="3.64">really entertaining to try to actually</text><text start="76.799" dur="4.041">calculate something using the randomness</text><text start="78.799" dur="3.801">of raindrop since we&amp;#39;ve been calculating</text><text start="80.84" dur="3.72">things all all of these pseudo random</text><text start="82.6" dur="3.839">numbers in a computer you can generate a</text><text start="84.56" dur="3.599">lot more of them but they&amp;#39;re less random</text><text start="86.439" dur="4.32">than something in the real world like</text><text start="88.159" dur="4.6">rainfalling so you know it only took</text><text start="90.759" dur="4.441">like 9 or 10 months but a couple weeks</text><text start="92.759" dur="4.801">ago I finally built the first prototype</text><text start="95.2" dur="4.72">that was able to detect raindrops and</text><text start="97.56" dur="5.839">yesterday I was able to collect the</text><text start="99.92" dur="6">First Data with this the money Carlo</text><text start="103.399" dur="5.241">technique is a very common numerical</text><text start="105.92" dur="6.559">method and it can be used to find the</text><text start="108.64" dur="6.119">answer to any calculation where the</text><text start="112.479" dur="6.32">calculations final result can be</text><text start="114.759" dur="6">expressed as a probability so you</text><text start="118.799" dur="3.841">generate a whole bunch of Rand numbers</text><text start="120.759" dur="3.96">evaluate them in some statement and then</text><text start="122.64" dur="4.839">the probability of that statement being</text><text start="124.719" dur="4.361">true is basically the the fraction that</text><text start="127.479" dur="4.161">you then pump back into your equation to</text><text start="129.08" dur="4.44">find your answer so in this case the</text><text start="131.64" dur="4.4">probability is that the Raindrop lands</text><text start="133.52" dur="6.4">on either the circle or the square</text><text start="136.04" dur="5.96">imagine you&amp;#39;ve got two squares and they</text><text start="139.92" dur="5.599">of equal size and they&amp;#39;re laying out in</text><text start="142" dur="6.56">the rain and raindrops start falling the</text><text start="145.519" dur="5.08">Raindrop has an equal chance of landing</text><text start="148.56" dur="4.12">on either of those squares</text><text start="150.599" dur="3.64">or a better question maybe which one of</text><text start="152.68" dur="3.72">those squares is going to get hit by a</text><text start="154.239" dur="3.961">raindrop first and the answer is you</text><text start="156.4" dur="4.919">have no idea because raindrops are</text><text start="158.2" dur="5.08">falling evenly everywhere now imagine</text><text start="161.319" dur="4.2">that you take one of those squares and</text><text start="163.28" dur="4.879">stretch it so that it&amp;#39;s twice as big</text><text start="165.519" dur="5.281">it&amp;#39;s got twice the area the raindrops</text><text start="168.159" dur="5.481">are going to be twice as likely to fall</text><text start="170.8" dur="5.24">on that rectangle than on the other one</text><text start="173.64" dur="4.599">that&amp;#39;s the square because it has more</text><text start="176.04" dur="5.32">area so the number of raindrops falling</text><text start="178.239" dur="5.601">on the shapes is is proportional to the</text><text start="181.36" dur="5.879">area of those shapes and that is</text><text start="183.84" dur="5.88">something that is at the core necessary</text><text start="187.239" dur="4.401">for the Mante Carlo method to work now</text><text start="189.72" dur="4.239">imagine that you take that rectangle and</text><text start="191.64" dur="4.12">you make some sort of bizarre Jagged cut</text><text start="193.959" dur="4.441">through the rectangle so it&amp;#39;s a really</text><text start="195.76" dur="4.399">bizarr looking shape that I you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="198.4" dur="5.08">want to sit there and try to calculate</text><text start="200.159" dur="5.64">the area of that shape but if you let it</text><text start="203.48" dur="4.2">sit out in the rain next to your</text><text start="205.799" dur="4.401">original Square which is the reference</text><text start="207.68" dur="4.68">at this point and you find out how many</text><text start="210.2" dur="4.72">raindrops fall on each of those shapes</text><text start="212.36" dur="5">you can get a rough estimate for the</text><text start="214.92" dur="3.92">area just based on how many raindrops</text><text start="217.36" dur="4.519">hit it no matter what the shape no</text><text start="218.84" dur="4.679">matter how crazy it is um the number of</text><text start="221.879" dur="3.761">raindrops that fall in that shape is</text><text start="223.519" dur="4.8">going to be proportional to that shape&amp;#39;s</text><text start="225.64" dur="4.64">area that&amp;#39;s all that I&amp;#39;m doing here I</text><text start="228.319" dur="4.721">have two different shapes and the number</text><text start="230.28" dur="6.48">of raindrops falling in each shape is</text><text start="233.04" dur="6.24">basically given a whole lot of raindrops</text><text start="236.76" dur="6.16">equivalent to the area of that shape</text><text start="239.28" dur="5.039">which means means that you can calculate</text><text start="242.92" dur="3.92">pi because you&amp;#39;re dealing with the</text><text start="244.319" dur="5">relative area of a circle into a square</text><text start="246.84" dur="5.2">in this case I have worked my hardest of</text><text start="249.319" dur="5.12">course sanding it by hand but I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="252.04" dur="4.439">attempted to get the diameter of the</text><text start="254.439" dur="4.561">circle equal to the edge length of the</text><text start="256.479" dur="6.201">square which means if the area of the</text><text start="259" dur="8.759">circle is p pi r s and the area of the</text><text start="262.68" dur="7">square is L squar as like one side then</text><text start="267.759" dur="4.081">the area of the square is actually d</text><text start="269.68" dur="3.72">squared using the circle units because</text><text start="271.84" dur="3.56">the diameter of the circle and the edge</text><text start="273.4" dur="3.4">length of the square are the same which</text><text start="275.4" dur="3.44">means that if you want to put them in</text><text start="276.8" dur="5.16">the exact same terms you&amp;#39;ve got to pull</text><text start="278.84" dur="8.079">out an extra factor of four because d^2</text><text start="281.96" dur="7.64">is actually 2 R 2ar which becomes 4 R</text><text start="286.919" dur="7.56">SAR and</text><text start="289.6" dur="7.72">um the area of the square is 4 r s and</text><text start="294.479" dur="4.841">the area of the circle is pi r 2 so the</text><text start="297.32" dur="4.599">relative number of raindrops that hit</text><text start="299.32" dur="5.2">each each the relative difference in</text><text start="301.919" dur="5.241">their areas is 4 over</text><text start="304.52" dur="6.08">Pi the real problem with the man Carlo</text><text start="307.16" dur="6">method for these two-dimensional systems</text><text start="310.6" dur="6.12">is that it takes a really long time to</text><text start="313.16" dur="7.479">converge it&amp;#39;s a really slow algorithm so</text><text start="316.72" dur="6.4">the estimate of the solution as you add</text><text start="320.639" dur="4.921">more and more data is going to wander</text><text start="323.12" dur="4.919">it&amp;#39;s going to go well above the actual</text><text start="325.56" dur="5.4">value and well below the actual value</text><text start="328.039" dur="6">and it is eventually going to sort of</text><text start="330.96" dur="7.4">settle and it&amp;#39;s settling because as you</text><text start="334.039" dur="6.081">have more data already logged every</text><text start="338.36" dur="3.76">additional data point it&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="340.12" dur="3.4">averaging one number into a thousand</text><text start="342.12" dur="3.88">numbers and then you&amp;#39;re averaging one</text><text start="343.52" dur="6.119">number into 10,000 numbers that one</text><text start="346" dur="8.4">number becomes less and less effective</text><text start="349.639" dur="7.921">at moving the average as the bulk of</text><text start="354.4" dur="5.16">data gets larger so that&amp;#39;s why the the</text><text start="357.56" dur="4.479">estimate sort of stops moving and it</text><text start="359.56" dur="4.12">does sort of narrow down after a while</text><text start="362.039" dur="3.921">and you can see here that it basically</text><text start="363.68" dur="4.639">starts to level off I wish I could have</text><text start="365.96" dur="4.639">gotten more data for this particular run</text><text start="368.319" dur="4.401">but this is actually one complete</text><text start="370.599" dur="4.32">rainstorm the rainstorms here don&amp;#39;t last</text><text start="372.72" dur="5.479">very long and uh it was a little over</text><text start="374.919" dur="5.56">2,000 raindrops that I was able to</text><text start="378.199" dur="4.521">record so this is really cool I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="380.479" dur="4.801">currently actually calculating the value</text><text start="382.72" dur="5.08">of p with raindrops falling on that</text><text start="385.28" dur="5.08">apparatus out there every drop makes it</text><text start="387.8" dur="4.839">a little bit uh doesn&amp;#39;t make it closer</text><text start="390.36" dur="4.88">to Pi but it gives me more data of of</text><text start="392.639" dur="4.441">which the average will be Pi now right</text><text start="395.24" dur="7.12">now it&amp;#39;s at</text><text start="397.08" dur="8.64">3.18 so I&amp;#39;ve got uh somewhere around</text><text start="402.36" dur="6.52">1,400 raindrops that have fallen so far</text><text start="405.72" dur="5.08">and actually hit the sensor so as more</text><text start="408.88" dur="4.96">raindrops fall that answer should get</text><text start="410.8" dur="3.04">closer and closer to</text><text start="413.96" dur="5.04">Pi that&amp;#39;s mathematically how the Monte</text><text start="416.4" dur="4.88">Carlo method works but physically it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="419" dur="4.319">actually very simple rig but it took me</text><text start="421.28" dur="5.88">a really long time to get it right it</text><text start="423.319" dur="5.361">was like a month of oh it&amp;#39;s raining I</text><text start="427.16" dur="3.2">need to go out and measure stuff oh</text><text start="428.68" dur="4.28">shoot something went wrong now I need to</text><text start="430.36" dur="5">fix it and it all boiled down to proper</text><text start="432.96" dur="4.12">grounding and proper waterproofing as it</text><text start="435.36" dur="4.36">turns out when you&amp;#39;re measuring signals</text><text start="437.08" dur="5.44">this small uh both of those are very</text><text start="439.72" dur="6.24">important so to ground the system I</text><text start="442.52" dur="5.399">literally have the ground wire that is</text><text start="445.96" dur="4.639">attached to the ground on the USB on my</text><text start="447.919" dur="4.601">computer coming in and it is attached to</text><text start="450.599" dur="4.6">this aluminum rod which just drives into</text><text start="452.52" dur="5.16">the ground and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="455.199" dur="4.28">actually only effective once you dump</text><text start="457.68" dur="4.32">water on it or of course if it&amp;#39;s raining</text><text start="459.479" dur="4.84">then that works too so you got to have a</text><text start="462" dur="4.879">wet steak into the ground I also have</text><text start="464.319" dur="4.641">the entire Underside yeah it&amp;#39;s all wet I</text><text start="466.879" dur="6.921">was using it the entire underside of</text><text start="468.96" dur="8.16">this covered in uh htpe and hot glue in</text><text start="473.8" dur="5.48">order to seal it all off because it</text><text start="477.12" dur="4.359">would normally run and it would count</text><text start="479.28" dur="4.44">rain drops perfectly for a little while</text><text start="481.479" dur="3.961">and then one of the sensor wires would</text><text start="483.72" dur="3.72">get wet which would add noise to the</text><text start="485.44" dur="4.52">channel and that noise looked like</text><text start="487.44" dur="3.96">raindrops which means that it would be</text><text start="489.96" dur="3.4">fine and then all of a sudden one</text><text start="491.4" dur="4.919">channel would just continuously get</text><text start="493.36" dur="5.679">dripped on the circle and the square</text><text start="496.319" dur="6.28">here that are the actual like sensor</text><text start="499.039" dur="5.241">plates are made of plywood and I</text><text start="502.599" dur="3.16">actually made them by hand I don&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="504.28" dur="3">access to a laser cutter right now but</text><text start="505.759" dur="3.681">even if I did I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="507.28" dur="5.52">used it because this is an approximation</text><text start="509.44" dur="5.36">method I want to do something and uh</text><text start="512.8" dur="4.32">approximate the value of pi so I did it</text><text start="514.8" dur="5.359">by hand it feels a little more analog</text><text start="517.12" dur="5.2">and these were actually uh mapped out</text><text start="520.159" dur="5.24">with a compass and a straight edge on a</text><text start="522.32" dur="5.16">piece of wood and I sanded them down</text><text start="525.399" dur="4.841">until everything reach the edges</text><text start="527.48" dur="5.56">perfectly and or as perfectly as you can</text><text start="530.24" dur="6.92">get working things by hand with a sander</text><text start="533.04" dur="6.72">and uh the only real necessity is that</text><text start="537.16" dur="4.359">the uh diameter of the circle circle is</text><text start="539.76" dur="5.28">the same as the edge length of the</text><text start="541.519" dur="7.481">square these could be really huge or</text><text start="545.04" dur="6.479">really small or anything as long as that</text><text start="549" dur="4.88">Dimension is as close to the same on</text><text start="551.519" dur="5.201">both objects as physically possible</text><text start="553.88" dur="2.84">that&amp;#39;s the important</text><text start="558.76" dur="7.23">[Laughter]</text><text start="562.92"

these</text><text start="621.12" dur="5.44">sensor plates is a little pazo electric</text><text start="623.76" dur="5.72">buzzer and that buzzer</text><text start="626.56" dur="5.36">is normally used as a speaker but</text><text start="629.48" dur="4.16">instead of using an electrical signal to</text><text start="631.92" dur="4">make a vibration you can also use a</text><text start="633.64" dur="4.439">vibration to make an electrical signal</text><text start="635.92" dur="5.2">and I actually used this technique to</text><text start="638.079" dur="5.961">detect uh someone knocking on a door for</text><text start="641.12" dur="5.36">the the doll door project which is</text><text start="644.04" dur="5.039">somewhere on the on my YouTube channel</text><text start="646.48" dur="5.32">and basically this makes a signal</text><text start="649.079" dur="3.44">Whenever there is a sharp tap on one of</text><text start="651.8" dur="4.08">the</text><text start="652.519" dur="7.041">sensors so when a raindrop actually hits</text><text start="655.88" dur="5.72">one of these plates it comes down and it</text><text start="659.56" dur="3.88">runs into the piece of wood actually</text><text start="661.6" dur="5">runs into the polyurethane coat on top</text><text start="663.44" dur="6.519">of the piece of wood and makes the whole</text><text start="666.6" dur="5.6">thing vibrate and that vibration gets</text><text start="669.959" dur="4.841">down to the sensor which ends up causing</text><text start="672.2" dur="5.4">a spike on the graph and you can see</text><text start="674.8" dur="6.32">that hitting the circle and hitting the</text><text start="677.6" dur="6.84">square are causing two different signals</text><text start="681.12" dur="5.159">to spike now it&amp;#39;s a little more elegant</text><text start="684.44" dur="3.88">than that because it&amp;#39;s not just counting</text><text start="686.279" dur="4.921">the computer is not recording the total</text><text start="688.32" dur="5.16">amount of vibration a on each plate it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="691.2" dur="4.6">actually counting individual raindrop</text><text start="693.48" dur="5.24">events so the program that actually</text><text start="695.8" dur="4.88">calculates the value of pi from all of</text><text start="698.72" dur="3.52">the raindrops hitting this sensor is</text><text start="700.68" dur="3.399">doing nothing except looking at the</text><text start="702.24" dur="3.48">ratio of the number of raindrops that</text><text start="704.079" dur="4.2">hit the square to the number of</text><text start="705.72" dur="4.239">raindrops that hit the circle so it</text><text start="708.279" dur="3.401">thinks that the number that hit the</text><text start="709.959" dur="5.521">circle over the number that hit the</text><text start="711.68" dur="5.08">square is supposed to be pi over 4 so if</text><text start="715.48" dur="3.64">we hit the</text><text start="716.76" dur="5.639">square three times and we hit the the</text><text start="719.12" dur="5.08">circle three times then six total rain</text><text start="722.399" dur="4.041">drops have hit the system but most</text><text start="724.2" dur="4.48">importantly three raindrops have hit</text><text start="726.44" dur="4.72">each which means that the ratio of the</text><text start="728.68" dur="5.599">number that hit the circle over the</text><text start="731.16" dur="5.44">number that hit the square is one and it</text><text start="734.279" dur="4.641">thinks that one is equal to four over Pi</text><text start="736.6" dur="4">so it thinks that Pi has to be four</text><text start="738.92" dur="4.599">which is of course not the correct</text><text start="740.6" dur="4.599">answer but if you have random raindrops</text><text start="743.519" dur="4.44">falling on this and you have enough</text><text start="745.199" dur="6.481">raindrops that eventually the average</text><text start="747.959" dur="5.641">ratio that you come up with will be pi</text><text start="751.68" dur="4.92">over four and that&amp;#39;s how you can extract</text><text start="753.6" dur="3">the real value of</text><text start="777.839" dur="3">pi</text><text start="784.44" dur="3.88">so you&amp;#39;re probably wondering why
