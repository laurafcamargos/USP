dur="3.92">and that&amp;#39;s what really interests me what</text><text start="11.679" dur="3.201">are they saying how much are they saying</text><text start="13.36" dur="4.16">why are they saying it</text><text start="14.88" dur="3.6">and a lot of the work that i do is about</text><text start="17.52" dur="4.16">finding out</text><text start="18.48" dur="6.4">mechanisms finding out how different</text><text start="21.68" dur="5.519">traits and abilities evolved so when you</text><text start="24.88" dur="4.319">see animals or any kind of life and you</text><text start="27.199" dur="4.641">notice that they have similarities so</text><text start="29.199" dur="3.281">we have forearms and legs and dogs do as</text><text start="31.84" dur="1.92">well then</text><text start="32.48" dur="3.44">there&amp;#39;s a couple of reasons why that</text><text start="33.76" dur="4">could be i mean it could be just that</text><text start="35.92" dur="3.04">they come from a common ancestor and we</text><text start="37.76" dur="3.92">all inherited</text><text start="38.96" dur="3.52">these traits however if you observe two</text><text start="41.68" dur="3.12">animals with</text><text start="42.48" dur="3.84">similar properties it may be that they</text><text start="44.8" dur="3.439">don&amp;#39;t inherit those properties from a</text><text start="46.32" dur="2.719">common ancestor but they just evolved</text><text start="48.239" dur="3.521">them both</text><text start="49.039" dur="4.561">separately because they were really good</text><text start="51.76" dur="3.2">solutions to the problem</text><text start="53.6" dur="3.04">that they were facing and the obvious</text><text start="54.96" dur="4.32">example of that for instance is</text><text start="56.64" dur="3.2">wings we know birds have wings bats have</text><text start="59.28" dur="2.959">wings</text><text start="59.84" dur="3.92">even insects have wings so wings are</text><text start="62.239" dur="4.441">convergent</text><text start="63.76" dur="6.059">that&amp;#39;s convergent evolution</text><text start="66.68" dur="3.139">[Music]</text><text start="70.08" dur="3.12">so one of the really interesting things</text><text start="71.92" dur="2.8">about wolves and dolphins is they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="73.2" dur="3.12">very very similar they don&amp;#39;t sound like</text><text start="74.72" dur="4">they&amp;#39;re similar but they really are</text><text start="76.32" dur="4.08">um they&amp;#39;re both very social animals</text><text start="78.72" dur="2.719">they&amp;#39;re both very intelligent animals</text><text start="80.4" dur="3.039">and they communicate</text><text start="81.439" dur="3.521">to establish their groups and their</text><text start="83.439" dur="3.281">societies so actually</text><text start="84.96" dur="4.32">their calls and their and the sounds</text><text start="86.72" dur="4.16">that they make are very very similar</text><text start="89.28" dur="3.28">they&amp;#39;re different in pitch but that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="90.88" dur="4">about it if you slow down a dolphin</text><text start="92.56" dur="2.32">whistle</text><text start="98.159" dur="5.28">it sounds just like a wolf howl</text><text start="100.19" dur="5.73">[Music]</text><text start="103.439" dur="4.561">it was incredibly striking just how</text><text start="105.92" dur="4.239">similar that visual representation</text><text start="108" dur="3.92">of a wolf howl appeared to the</text><text start="110.159" dur="3.441">representations of the dolphin whistles</text><text start="111.92" dur="4.799">that i&amp;#39;d been working with</text><text start="113.6" dur="5.68">and that was a that was a an important</text><text start="116.719" dur="3.36">moment it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a novel</text><text start="119.28" dur="3.28">observation</text><text start="120.079" dur="3.841">but it made me realize that that the</text><text start="122.56" dur="3.919">processes behind</text><text start="123.92" dur="3.6">why these animals use these particular</text><text start="126.479" dur="2.801">kinds of sounds</text><text start="127.52" dur="3.6">were probably similar there was probably</text><text start="129.28" dur="4.56">something similar going on</text><text start="131.12" dur="4.56">once you start finding all these common</text><text start="133.84" dur="4.32">behaviors and common mechanisms</text><text start="135.68" dur="3.76">on earth then it&amp;#39;s a very small jump to</text><text start="138.16" dur="3.439">realize that these are the same</text><text start="139.44" dur="4.08">mechanisms that are going to be working</text><text start="141.599" dur="3.681">elsewhere in the universe and a lot of</text><text start="143.52" dur="3.2">the same constraints that</text><text start="145.28" dur="3.2">animals face on earth a lot of the same</text><text start="146.72" dur="3.84">problems animals have to solve</text><text start="148.48" dur="9.36">on earth are similar problems to the</text><text start="150.56" dur="7.28">ones that are going to solve elsewhere</text><text start="162.16" dur="3.84">so the one thing that we can be really</text><text start="164.239" dur="4.561">confident of is that</text><text start="166" dur="4.959">complex life or complexity of any sort</text><text start="168.8" dur="4.4">really can only only arise in</text><text start="170.959" dur="3.601">in one way that&amp;#39;s if it accumulates</text><text start="173.2" dur="4.24">slowly nothing</text><text start="174.56" dur="4.8">pops into being incredibly complex and</text><text start="177.44" dur="3.92">sophisticated like an animal</text><text start="179.36" dur="3.84">so they must have come from simpler</text><text start="181.36" dur="5.12">organisms and that process of</text><text start="183.2" dur="5.759">simplicity accumulating complexity</text><text start="186.48" dur="3.759">is what we call evolution on earth and</text><text start="188.959" dur="2">these are really the these are the</text><text start="190.239" dur="3.841">things that</text><text start="190.959" dur="5.121">we know are going to be in common um</text><text start="194.08" dur="4">across the universe there are also</text><text start="196.08" dur="3.28">constraints on on life that we know are</text><text start="198.08" dur="3.36">common across the universe so for</text><text start="199.36" dur="3.76">instance all life needs energy</text><text start="201.44" dur="3.359">you can&amp;#39;t have life without energy and</text><text start="203.12" dur="3.44">that&amp;#39;s going to be the same whatever</text><text start="204.799" dur="3.841">planet you&amp;#39;re on so some of the things</text><text start="206.56" dur="3.52">about extraterrestrial life are going to</text><text start="208.64" dur="2.48">be very surprising there&amp;#39;s no doubt</text><text start="210.08" dur="2.96">about that a lot of</text><text start="211.12" dur="4.32">a lot of the way the animals are on</text><text start="213.04" dur="3.919">earth is the result of coincidences</text><text start="215.44" dur="3.04">and and that&amp;#39;s going to be the same on</text><text start="216.959" dur="2.721">any planet but there are some things</text><text start="218.48" dur="3.92">that are going to be</text><text start="219.68" dur="3.279">in common um things like uh simple</text><text start="222.4" dur="3.919">things like</text><text start="222.959" dur="5.441">having predators and prey if energy is</text><text start="226.319" dur="4.48">something that all life needs then then</text><text start="228.4" dur="2.399">sooner or</text><text start="239.36" dur="4.079">on other later is that animals or the</text><text start="241.68" dur="3.52">equivalent of animals will come together</text><text start="243.439" dur="2.481">in societies they&amp;#39;ll come together in</text><text start="245.2" dur="2.08">groups</text><text start="245.92" dur="3.519">because there are many things that you</text><text start="247.28" dur="3.039">can do better in a group than you can do</text><text start="249.439" dur="3.041">on your own</text><text start="250.319" dur="4.081">so so many of the behaviors we see on</text><text start="252.48" dur="14.56">earth will be replicated elsewhere in</text><text start="254.4" dur="12.64">the universe as well</text></transcript>
