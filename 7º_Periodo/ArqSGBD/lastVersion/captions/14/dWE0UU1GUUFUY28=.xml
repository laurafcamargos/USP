this phase</text><text start="205.04" dur="3.759">seems like it should be the easiest a</text><text start="207.2" dur="3.28">teacher checks your homework but</text><text start="208.799" dur="3.041">often it&amp;#39;s quite troublesome the first</text><text start="210.48" dur="3.44">problem is finding an</text><text start="211.84" dur="4.319">expert if a video ends up being largely</text><text start="213.92" dur="3.2">a book or paper adaptation and the</text><text start="216.159" dur="2.561">author is alive</text><text start="217.12" dur="2.88">then that&amp;#39;s pretty easy and those</text><text start="218.72" dur="3.2">projects are generally more</text><text start="220" dur="2.64">straightforward but for a lot of videos</text><text start="221.92" dur="3.52">figuring out</text><text start="222.64" dur="3.76">who is the expert on this thing isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="225.44" dur="3.04">always clear</text><text start="226.4" dur="3.04">and for some topics there simply isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="228.48" dur="3.119">anyone for others</text><text start="229.44" dur="3.999">experts may exist but finding them is</text><text start="231.599" dur="4.081">basically impossible because there isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="233.439" dur="4.08">a good public record of their expertise</text><text start="235.68" dur="3.919">this last is particularly frustrating</text><text start="237.519" dur="2.561">because the instant the final video goes</text><text start="239.599" dur="2.801">up all</text><text start="240.08" dur="3.28">the unfindable experts will find it and</text><text start="242.4" dur="2.64">get in touch</text><text start="243.36" dur="3.439">now in theory this problem could be</text><text start="245.04" dur="3.119">solved by publicly announcing what the</text><text start="246.799" dur="2.881">active topics are and</text><text start="248.159" dur="3.841">back when past gray&amp;#39;s channel was</text><text start="249.68" dur="4.559">smaller and he younger and naiver that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="252" dur="4.079">totally a thing he did but current gray</text><text start="254.239" dur="4.081">in current year has seen shockingly</text><text start="256.079" dur="4.481">blatant cases of those who work fast</text><text start="258.32" dur="4.24">scooping topics from those who work slow</text><text start="260.56" dur="4">it&amp;#39;s not the early days of the internet</text><text start="262.56" dur="4.16">anymore and surviving while supporting a</text><text

in progress</text><text start="282.32" dur="4.159">even if the topic is unscooped or</text><text start="284.32" dur="3.84">unscoopable i just find projects harder</text><text start="286.479"

to keep a</text><text start="294.72" dur="3.28">secret for possibly months</text><text start="296" dur="3.28">then that&amp;#39;s great but it can still be</text><text start="298" dur="3.36">tricky for example</text><text start="299.28" dur="3.84">witch experts just about any academic</text><text start="301.36" dur="4.08">topic will have experts who have spent</text><text start="303.12" dur="5.359">their entire lives thinking about this</text><text start="305.44" dur="4.72">one area and who also violently disagree</text><text start="308.479" dur="4">with each other which can leave
