<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0" dur="14.4">[Music]</text><text start="10.58" dur="5.83">so last year I saw a picture that my</text><text start="14.4" dur="4.02">parents sent me that a friend of theirs</text><text start="16.41" dur="4.86">who&amp;#39;s actually a real woodworker made</text><text start="18.42" dur="5.13">and it was a multi-layer wooden</text><text start="21.27" dur="4.499">Christmas tree all made of flat stock</text><text start="23.55" dur="4.049">that was cut out into like star sort of</text><text start="25.769" dur="3.241">patterns so when you put them all</text><text start="27.599" dur="3.361">together into a cone it looked like a</text><text start="29.01" dur="3.87">tree and it was really cool and I saw</text><text start="30.96" dur="3.75">that and thought I could make that out</text><text start="32.88" dur="4.44">of a laser the tree is made of a whole</text><text start="34.71" dur="4.05">bunch of stacked layers and I designed</text><text start="37.32" dur="4.05">the thing in Illustrator so every one of</text><text start="38.76" dur="6.36">those layers is actually a seven-pointed</text><text start="41.37" dur="7.59">star made with the illustrator polygon</text><text start="45.12" dur="6.869">tool and I used the pucker tool on that</text><text start="48.96" dur="21.12">star to sort of make all the end spikey</text><text start="51.989" dur="19.95">and look like pine needles on a tree so</text><text start="70.08" dur="4.02">the first step with any thing that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="71.939" dur="5.97">laser-cut like this aside from actually</text><text start="74.1" dur="6.21">cutting it out on the laser is to crank</text><text start="77.909" dur="4.471">all of the pieces out of there cut</text><text start="80.31" dur="4.5">sheets now as you can see a lot of these</text><text start="82.38" dur="5.099">need an awful lot of touch-up work</text><text start="84.81" dur="4.98">they&amp;#39;ve got like edges hanging off of</text><text start="87.479" dur="6.631">them and all sorts of nastiness so I</text><text start="89.79" dur="5.82">have a set of files right here and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="94.11" dur="2.98">going to take a while but they all need</text><text start="95.61" dur="12.609">to be cleaned up</text><text start="97.09" dur="11.129">[Music]</text><text start="109.06" dur="4.24">so the real fun part about this base is</text><text start="111.68" dur="5.39">how it all just sort of snap fits</text><text start="113.3" dur="6">together these two brackets right here</text><text start="117.07" dur="7.26">there&amp;#39;s actually a thick side and a thin</text><text start="119.3" dur="9.42">side the thick side slots into this base</text><text start="124.33" dur="12.76">and then this central spine goes in next</text><text start="128.72" dur="10.65">to it it&amp;#39;s a pretty tight fit</text><text start="137.09" dur="5.73">but it should be holds it together and</text><text start="139.37" dur="11.88">then the other L bracket goes on the</text><text start="142.82" dur="10.46">other side the next big circle piece</text><text start="151.25" dur="6.59">that has a plus sign in it looks like</text><text start="153.28" dur="10.78">it&amp;#39;s threaded all the way down the spire</text><text start="157.84" dur="8.64">and actually pushes over those L</text><text start="164.06" dur="8.819">brackets to stabilize the base</text><text start="166.48" dur="8.63">[Music]</text><text start="172.879" dur="4.72">you&amp;#39;ll notice that some of these spacers</text><text start="175.11" dur="4.11">have instead of a rectangle actually a</text><text start="177.599" dur="2.941">plus sign in them and there&amp;#39;s only a</text><text start="179.22" dur="3.659">handful of those I think there&amp;#39;s four</text><text start="180.54" dur="6.72">yeah here&amp;#39;s the fourth one and those</text><text start="182.879" dur="6.601">form the bottom trunk of the tree so</text><text start="187.26" dur="6.27">they are going to go just far enough to</text><text start="189.48" dur="10.56">cover all of the plus sign across</text><text start="193.53" dur="9.12">section the bottom still has this cross</text><text start="200.04" dur="4.949">sign so one of the very last steps is to</text><text start="202.65" dur="4.5">take the plain disk and just glue it</text><text start="204.989" dur="5.34">over the bottom and that will lock all</text><text start="207.15" dur="6.239">of this in place in order to assemble</text><text start="210.329" dur="5.97">the tree with all of these layers you</text><text start="213.389" dur="6.27">just start with the biggest layer thread</text><text start="216.299" dur="5.761">it onto the cork because all of these</text><text start="219.659" dur="8.821">layers have the properly sized</text><text start="222.06" dur="9.899">rectangular holes in them like that and</text><text start="228.48" dur="11.67">then you put three of these spacers in</text><text start="231.959" dur="12">between each layer you want to alternate</text><text start="240.15" dur="6.149">so this every other layer where the key</text><text start="243.959" dur="5.42">holes line up they actually point in</text><text start="246.299" dur="5.94">opposite directions so here I have the</text><text start="249.379" dur="4.991">keyhole pointed towards this which means</text><text start="252.239" dur="4.47">that I want the next layer to point down</text><text start="254.37" dur="7.25">so that they&amp;#39;re staggered so find the</text><text start="256.709" dur="4.911">top of this join it the right way</text><text start="262.27" dur="5.84">[Music]</text><text start="265.52" dur="3.85">and thread it on like that so they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="268.11" dur="4.8">actually pointed in slightly different</text><text start="269.37" dur="5.46">directions and all the wall all the way</text><text start="272.91" dur="10.95">up they will be staggered and it looks</text><text start="274.83" dur="11.309">really nice the only thing left to do is</text><text start="283.86" dur="4.679">to glue the bottom on to the bottom</text><text start="286.139" dur="4.801">which just sort of anchors together all</text><text start="288.539" dur="5.611">over the pressure fit stuff drop a</text><text start="290.94" dur="5.699">little bit of glue into this top by star</text><text start="294.15" dur="4.94">piece just to make sure that they&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="296.639" dur="5.071">never like delaminate a little bit and</text><text start="299.09" dur="7.6">this star that slots over the top</text><text start="301.71" dur="6.42">it&amp;#39;s these on either side of it just to</text><text start="306.69" dur="3.479">finish it off and make it look a little</text><text start="308.13" dur="4.17">nicer you could probably get away with</text><text start="310.169" dur="4.201">cyanoacrylate or something like that but</text><text start="312.3" dur="4.72">I&amp;#39;m going to actually be using some one</text><text start="314.37" dur="16.07">glue just to make it a little bit nicer</text><text start="317.02" dur="13.42">[Music]</text><text start="347.749" dur="6.01">along the edges of the tree there are a</text><text start="350.819" dur="4.59">lot of places where the laser didn&amp;#39;t cut</text><text start="353.759" dur="3.69">all the way through the wood completely</text><text start="355.409" dur="4.141">which meant that I had to sand and clean</text><text start="357.449" dur="4.77">up a lot of the edges which means that a</text><text start="359.55" dur="5.729">lot of the edges of these tree limbs I</text><text start="362.219" dur="4.62">guess are light at the bottom because</text><text start="365.279" dur="3.03">that&amp;#39;s where I had to sand it so it</text><text start="366.839" dur="2.85">doesn&amp;#39;t look charred anymore and it</text><text start="368.309" dur="4.53">makes the whole tree look pretty</text><text start="369.689" dur="6.09">irregular so this is just like scratch</text><text start="372.839" dur="6.151">cover polish and I&amp;#39;m going to use that</text><text start="375.779" dur="4.85">to basically just artificially darken</text><text start="378.99" dur="4.049">all of these spots so the whole the</text><text start="380.629" dur="6.27">edges of all of the pieces of wood look</text><text start="383.039" dur="3.86">the same before it gets polyurethane</text><text start="405.2" dur="4.75">once you wait a couple days for the</text><text start="407.49" dur="4.71">polyurethane to dry it ends up looking</text><text start="409.95" dur="4.02">real nice and of course it&amp;#39;s not a real</text><text start="412.2" dur="3.55">Christmas tree but it makes a great</text><text start="413.97" dur="5.75">decoration around the house</text><text start="415.75" dur="5.84">[Music]</text><text start="419.72" dur="10.72">[Applause]</text><text start="421.59" dur="11.36">[Music]</text><text start="430.44"
