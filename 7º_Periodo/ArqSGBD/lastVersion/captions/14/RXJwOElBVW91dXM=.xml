are security reasons</text><text start="136.74" dur="2.88">you should know Inc thus the tax</text><text start="138.06" dur="3.63">department piggybacked off of the work</text><text start="139.62" dur="3.87">fiscal security department did assigning</text><text start="141.69" dur="4.65">working adults a number which made</text><text start="143.49" dur="4.74">tracking taxes easier and they

start="167.94" dur="5.01">asking nay begging people to lie which</text><text start="171.12" dur="4.23">they did birthing on paper</text><text start="172.95" dur="4.2">millions of phantom children but after</text><text start="175.35" dur="3.75">requiring each kid to have a social</text><text start="177.15" dur="3.9">security account number connected to a</text><text start="179.1" dur="4.08">birth certificate before the parents</text><text start="181.05" dur="5.01">could get the tax discount all those</text><text start="183.18" dur="4.74">phantoms faded away this turned the</text><text start="186.06" dur="4.23">social security number into a unique</text><text start="187.92" dur="4.11">number that all citizens had right from</text><text start="190.29" dur="3.69">the start and that made it easy for lots</text><text start="192.03" dur="3.84">of other places like banks and schools</text><text start="193.98" dur="3.87">and companies and landlords to also</text><text start="195.87" dur="3.96">piggyback on the number as an easy way</text><text start="197.85" dur="4.05">to keep track of people without having</text><text start="199.83" dur="4.5">to come up with their own systems and to</text><text start="201.9" dur="4.71">be able to exchange information about</text><text start="204.33" dur="4.98">people between institutions this is</text><text start="206.61" dur="4.8">super useful for institutions so the</text><text start="209.31" dur="4.32">desire of Americans to not have a</text><text start="211.41" dur="4.17">national identity card led somewhat</text><text start="213.63" dur="3.99">inevitably to the nearest thing</text><text start="215.58" dur="3.9">available being used as a substitute</text><text start="217.62" dur="3.12">which ended up being worse because the</text><text start="219.48" dur="3.24">social security number was never</text><text start="220.74" dur="4.65">designed to be used this way in the long</text><text start="222.72" dur="4.77">long ago and you can tell because it has</text><text start="225.39" dur="3.48">no security built into it okay so</text><text start="227.49" dur="2.82">there&amp;#39;s this neat trick that most ID</text><text start="228.87" dur="3.6">numbers use where they can check</text><text start="230.31" dur="3.84">themselves to see if their invalid the</text><text start="232.47" dur="3.6">simplest way is to have the last couple</text><text start="234.15" dur="4.41">digits match the some of the others all</text><text start="236.07" dur="4.62">kinds of ID cards and bar codes do this</text><text start="238.56" dur="3.93">because it makes it impossible to enter</text><text start="240.69" dur="3.72">an incorrect number in a computer and</text><text start="242.49" dur="4.469">makes it harder for fraudsters to guess</text><text start="244.41" dur="4.38">valid numbers this is why if you try to</text><text start="246.959" dur="3.511">buy something online by guessing a</text><text start="248.79" dur="4.2">credit card number the website knows</text><text start="250.47" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s invalid before you even click buy</text><text start="252.99" dur="4.08">but because the social security number</text><text start="255.03" dur="4.68">started life in the long long ago it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="257.07" dur="4.86">just a number with no self checking</text><text start="259.71" dur="4.56">security built in worse if you were born</text><text start="261.93" dur="4.53">pree 2011 it&amp;#39;s not that hard to just</text><text start="264.27" dur="3.69">guess most of the number the first three</text><text start="266.46" dur="3.45">digits are the state where the parents</text><text start="267.96" dur="4.23">applied for the card and the last four</text><text start="269.91" dur="4.47">digits just count up in order and the</text><text start="272.19" dur="5.4">middle digits follow a regular pattern</text><text start="274.38" dur="5.46">so you can take your number subtract one</text><text start="277.59" dur="4.35">and that&amp;#39;s a valid number of someone who</text><text start="279.84" dur="4.77">was probably born in the same hospital</text><text start="281.94" dur="4.289">as you around the same time thus a</text><text start="284.61" dur="3.6">fraudster who knows your time and</text><text start="286.229" dur="3.81">location of birth can probably get the</text><text start="288.21" dur="3.989">first five digits by just looking them</text><text start="290.039" dur="4.41">up on a chart institutions ask for the</text><text start="292.199" dur="4.231">last four digits as a code to identify</text><text start="294.449" dur="4.351">you as you which means it&amp;#39;s not that</text><text start="296.43" dur="4.41">hard to put together your number from a</text><text start="298.8" dur="4.14">security leak anywhere or just by</text><text start="300.84" dur="4.44">connecting a few puzzle pieces the</text><text start="302.94" dur="4.68">physical card itself is no help either</text><text start="305.28" dur="4.44">just a literal piece of cardboard</text><text start="307.62" dur="3.479">depending on when it was issued not even</text><text start="309.72" dur="3.06">laminated the social security department</text><text start="311.099" dur="3.511">used to print not to be used for</text><text start="312.78" dur="3.569">identification on the cards as a futile</text><text start="314.61" dur="3.89">attempt to stop institutions for asking</text><text start="316.349" dur="4.921">for them as IDs because there&amp;#39;s nothing</text><text start="318.5" dur="4.539">identifying a person on the card but</text><text start="321.27" dur="4.019">eventually they gave up and remove these</text><text start="323.039" dur="4.141">words because unlike passports or</text><text start="325.289" dur="4.951">driver&amp;#39;s license you can assume all</text><text start="327.18" dur="5.19">Americans will have this one card all</text><text start="330.24" dur="4.38">this means your Social Security card and</text><text start="332.37" dur="4.74">number probably have less security than</text><text start="334.62" dur="5.549">your library card while being vastly</text><text start="337.11" dur="5.25">more important so it fails at being a</text><text start="340.169" dur="4.861">secure number it fails at being a good</text><text start="342.36" dur="4.679">ID card but at least it is Universal</text><text start="345.03" dur="4.8">which is why people use it though hello</text><text

rights to</text><text start="361.62" dur="3.66">getting any in the future which seems</text><text start="363.27" dur="3.51">fair in addition you must also be a</text><text start="365.28" dur="3.509">member of a religion opposed to the idea</text><text start="366.78" dur="3.72">of Social Security usually because of</text><text start="368.789" dur="3.87">the kind of insurance and
