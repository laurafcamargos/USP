dur="4.109">through one of the slots in this</text><text start="13.71" dur="4.62">spinning disk and then you go all the</text><text start="16.139" dur="4.381">way to that cliff out there two miles</text><text start="18.33" dur="4.26">away where you find a reflector that I</text><text start="20.52" dur="3.839">put there like an hour ago when you hit</text><text start="22.59" dur="3.84">that reflector you travel all the way</text><text start="24.359" dur="4.051">back to this spot you pass through a</text><text start="26.43" dur="4.589">different slot in this same disc through</text><text start="28.41" dur="5.79">another aperture and then you travel all</text><text start="31.019" dur="5.161">the way over here into this digital</text><text start="34.2" dur="3.48">camera when you hit that camera the</text><text start="36.18" dur="3.57">camera just sees a little green dot</text><text start="37.68" dur="5.25">because that&amp;#39;s what a reflected laser</text><text start="39.75" dur="4.829">over for miles looks like however this</text><text start="42.93" dur="3.99">isn&amp;#39;t a very terribly interesting setup</text><text start="44.579" dur="4.351">you&amp;#39;re just seeing a green dot when it</text><text start="46.92" dur="4.2">gets interesting is when we make that</text><text start="48.93" dur="3.78">disc spin so again imagine that you are</text><text start="51.12" dur="3.029">a beam of light leaving that laser you</text><text start="52.71" dur="2.759">come over here you pass through this</text><text start="54.149"

20</text><text start="60.09" dur="3.69">microseconds that it takes you to go to</text><text start="61.68" dur="5.07">that cliff and back this disc is moved</text><text start="63.78" dur="4.769">so instead of passing through a slot in</text><text start="66.75" dur="3.57">the disc passing through the aperture</text><text start="68.549" dur="3.691">and going into the camera you instead</text><text start="70.32" dur="3.45">run into a piece of black cardboard</text><text start="72.24" dur="5.1">because it&amp;#39;s not a slot there anymore</text><text start="73.77" dur="5.639">and you never make

dur="4.86">turn on and off in a photograph however</text><text start="83.939" dur="4.531">this is the technique that was actually</text><text start="86.43" dur="6.53">used to first measure the speed

distance</text><text start="104.59" dur="3.93">that an object can travel in a certain</text><text start="107.17" dur="3.33">amount of time now if we take the</text><text start="108.52" dur="4.26">example of a runner on a track this is</text><text start="110.5" dur="4.799">really easy to visualize when I see the</text><text start="112.78" dur="4.649">runner crossed the 300 line I start my</text><text start="115.299" dur="4.801">watch now I&amp;#39;m gonna wait until the</text><text start="117.429" dur="5.521">runner passes the 400 line stop my watch</text><text start="120.1" dur="5.549">and then divide that distance traveled</text><text start="122.95" dur="4.739">100 meters by the time it took so any</text><text start="125.649" dur="4.83">speed is just a distance divided by a</text><text start="127.689" dur="9.151">time like miles per hour or meters per</text><text start="130.479" dur="7.861">second okay 16 seconds I&amp;#39;m not in high</text><text start="136.84" dur="3.3">school anymore but you know it&amp;#39;s still a</text><text start="138.34" dur="5.13">valid measurement that means that the</text><text start="140.14" dur="5.67">speed was about 100 meters per 16</text><text start="143.47" dur="3.81">seconds so about 6 meters per second now</text><text start="145.81" dur="3.39">at these speeds that&amp;#39;s a completely</text><text start="147.28" dur="4.17">valid measurement but it&amp;#39;s worth noting</text><text start="149.2" dur="4.77">that I didn&amp;#39;t actually start my watch</text><text start="151.45" dur="4.86">when the runner crossed the 300 line I</text><text start="153.97" dur="4.739">started my watch when I saw the runner</text><text start="156.31" dur="4.47">across the 300 line light from the</text><text start="158.709" dur="4.081">runner needs to reach me 100 meters away</text><text start="160.78" dur="4.32">and it&amp;#39;s going to be traveling at C the</text><text start="162.79" dur="4.89">speed of light so if the runner is also</text><text start="165.1" dur="4.77">traveling at C then I&amp;#39;m going to see the</text><text start="167.68" dur="4.2">runner across the 300 line at the same</text><text start="169.87" dur="4.41">time that the runner crosses the 400</text><text start="171.88" dur="4.169">line and clearly that doesn&amp;#39;t make any</text><text start="174.28" dur="3.75">sense at all so if we want to measure</text><text start="176.049" dur="4.081">something as fast as the speed of light</text><text start="178.03" dur="3.69">like the speed of light we&amp;#39;re gonna need</text><text start="180.13" dur="4.199">to do something slightly more clever</text><text start="181.72" dur="5.34">byfa shows time scientists knew that</text><text start="184.329" dur="4.771">light whatever it was had a finite speed</text><text start="187.06" dur="4.47">and they&amp;#39;d actually estimated that speed</text><text start="189.1" dur="4.469">by precisely timing astronomical events</text><text start="191.53" dur="4.14">like the transit of Iowa Cross Jupiter</text><text start="193.569" dur="5.64">accounting for the relative motion of</text><text start="195.67" dur="6.149">Earth during those observations in 1676</text><text start="199.209" dur="4.771">Romer calculated that light takes about</text><text start="201.819" dur="4.2">22 minutes to travel the diameter of</text><text start="203.98" dur="4.229">Earth&amp;#39;s orbit that&amp;#39;s about 30 percent</text><text start="206.019" dur="3.931">away from the you know modern accepted</text><text start="208.209" dur="3.451">value of the speed of light today and</text><text start="209.95" dur="3.33">it&amp;#39;s not a very satisfying answer</text><text start="211.66" dur="3.63">because it&amp;#39;s in terms of astronomical</text><text start="213.28" dur="4.41">units it was another hundred and</text><text start="215.29" dur="4.11">seventy-three years before fazil was</text><text start="217.69" dur="3.87">able to measure the speed of light on</text><text start="219.4" dur="4.079">Earth&amp;#39;s surface for the first time this</text><text start="221.56" dur="3.929">is my modern day replica of the fa&amp;#39;sho</text><text start="223.479" dur="3.301">apparatus I did a little bit of googling</text><text start="225.489" dur="3.481">before I started on this</text><text start="226.78" dur="4.86">and I couldn&amp;#39;t find anybody that had</text><text start="228.97" dur="4.2">successfully recreated this experiment</text><text start="231.64" dur="3.27">so I think it&amp;#39;s really exciting that</text><text start="233.17" dur="3.96">this may be the first measure apparatus</text><text start="234.91" dur="4.35">spinning up in almost 170 years</text><text start="237.13" dur="4.92">that said I&amp;#39;ve modernized the design</text><text start="239.26" dur="7.77">just a little bit I replaced large focus</text><text start="242.05" dur="7.17">lamps with a laser a complicated and the</text><text start="247.03" dur="4.11">human eye with a digital camera but the</text><text start="249.22" dur="3.75">physics that allows this machine to</text><text start="251.14" dur="3.84">measure the speed of light is true to</text><text start="252.97" dur="3.84">the original it&amp;#39;s effectively turning a</text><text start="254.98" dur="3.9">light on and waiting to see the light</text><text start="256.81" dur="3.69">come back and then turning light off and</text><text start="258.88" dur="3.99">waiting to see the reflection vanish</text><text start="260.5" dur="4.86">except it does this tens of thousands of</text><text start="262.87" dur="4.5">times per second without electric lights</text><text start="265.36" dur="4.2">cause you&amp;#39;ll achieve this by shining a</text><text start="267.37" dur="4.26">lamp through a slotted wheel every time</text><text start="269.56" dur="4.2">the light passes through a slot it&amp;#39;s on</text><text start="271.63" dur="3.81">and every time the beam hits a tooth and</text><text start="273.76" dur="4.23">doesn&amp;#39;t pass through the disk the light</text><text start="275.44" dur="4.62">is off as those pulses of light leave</text><text start="277.99" dur="4.26">the apparatus on their 20 microsecond</text><text start="280.06" dur="4.35">trip from campus point to coil point and</text><text start="282.25" dur="4.26">back the disk keep spinning for</text><text start="284.41" dur="4.77">simplicity let&amp;#39;s assume that the wheel</text><text start="286.51" dur="5.04">only has two slots every time that a</text><text start="289.18" dur="4.26">slot exposes the laser a pulse of light</text><text start="291.55" dur="4.08">passes through the disk and shoots away</text><text start="293.44" dur="4.41">from the apparatus if we reflect the</text><text start="295.63" dur="4.53">light back with a mirror the returning</text><text start="297.85" dur="4.02">light casts a shadow of the disk and the</text><text start="300.16" dur="3.9">light passes backwards through the</text><text start="301.87" dur="4.08">second slot if you were looking through</text><text start="304.06" dur="7.41">that slot you could see the returning</text><text start="305.95" dur="7.83">light now imagine that the wheel is</text><text start="311.47" dur="4.08">going so fast that in the time it takes</text><text start="313.78" dur="5.01">for light to go to the mirror and back</text><text start="315.55" dur="5.16">the disk actually has time to move when</text><text start="318.79" dur="3.66">the returning light casts a shadow the</text><text start="320.71" dur="3.42">second slot isn&amp;#39;t where it used to be</text><text start="322.45" dur="3.75">and if you were standing still the whole</text><text start="324.13" dur="4.56">time you would no longer see the light</text><text start="326.2" dur="4.529">to do a quick example here the shadow</text><text start="328.69" dur="3.78">appeared to rotate by a quarter of a</text><text start="330.729" dur="4.021">revolution when the disk was spinning at</text><text start="332.47" dur="5.31">twenty rpm meaning that the light took</text><text start="334.75" dur="4.71">1/4 divided by 20 or 0.01 to five</text><text start="337.78" dur="4.17">minutes which is three-quarters of a</text><text start="339.46" dur="5.34">second of course the actual disk has</text><text start="341.95" dur="4.8">many more teeth that are very narrow and</text><text start="344.8" dur="4.08">it moves much faster because we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="346.75" dur="4.56">timing the round-trip of light over just</text><text start="348.88" dur="4.41">two miles which only takes about 20</text><text start="351.31" dur="4.74">microseconds so the disk barely has time</text><text start="353.29" dur="4.68">to move at all if we were also to</text><text start="356.05" dur="3.61">measure the distance between the wheel</text><text start="357.97" dur="3.67">and the mirror we would have Bo</text><text start="359.66" dur="3.99">the distance the light traveled and the</text><text start="361.64" dur="4.02">time it took everything we need to</text><text start="363.65" dur="3.24">calculate the speed of light so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="365.66" dur="3.72">going to show you how this whole setup</text><text start="366.89" dur="4.41">works for real but first we need to wait</text><text start="369.38" dur="4.02">for the Sun to go down because the laser</text><text start="371.3" dur="3.66">beam that&amp;#39;s reflected you know four</text><text start="373.4" dur="3.87">miles away through a not terribly</text><text start="374.96" dur="4.86">efficient retroreflector is going to be</text><text start="377.27" dur="4.14">pretty faint and my eye in the camera</text><text start="379.82" dur="3.06">need to be able to see that returning</text><text start="381.41" dur="20.61">light and right now they can&amp;#39;t because</text><text start="382.88" dur="21.12">the daylight washes it out okay so now</text><text start="402.02" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s dark as you can tell by the fact</text><text start="404" dur="3.93">that we&amp;#39;ve had to pull out all these</text><text start="405.02" dur="5.46">lights and the first step is to align</text><text start="407.93" dur="5.04">the laser to point at the retroreflector</text><text start="410.48" dur="4.05">that is at coal oil point so it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="412.97" dur="3.9">retroreflector which means that as soon</text><text start="414.53" dur="4.02">as we hit it with light the light that</text><text start="416.87" dur="3.69">hits that reflector is going to come</text><text start="418.55" dur="3.6">straight back to us but that doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="420.56" dur="3.51">really make things easier on our end</text><text start="422.15" dur="4.14">because we still have to be able to aim</text><text start="424.07" dur="5.01">at something that&amp;#39;s a few feet across</text><text start="426.29" dur="4.92">that&amp;#39;s two miles away because it&amp;#39;s going</text><text start="429.08" dur="4.68">to be so difficult to aim this laser I</text><text start="431.21" dur="4.32">bought a new super sturdy tripod just</text><text start="433.76" dur="4.29">for this experiment and I built an</text><text start="435.53" dur="5.01">adapter that allows me to put this green</text><text start="438.05" dur="4.32">dot laser sight on the on the ball joint</text><text start="440.54" dur="4.32">at the top of the tripod now the nice</text><text start="442.37" dur="4.95">thing about using a laser sight is that</text><text start="444.86" dur="4.02">it&amp;#39;s intended to be adjusted so it&amp;#39;s got</text><text start="447.32" dur="3.18">these fine adjustment knobs on the top</text><text start="448.88" dur="4.17">and on the side then our gonna let me</text><text start="450.5" dur="4.65">hone in this laser every tick of these</text><text start="453.05" dur="4.74">knobs is like a 4-foot movement two</text><text start="455.15" dur="4.29">miles from here and I am expecting the</text><text start="457.79" dur="4.98">beam it&amp;#39;s going to be about 11 feet in</text><text start="459.44" dur="6.71">diameter so I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of room</text><text start="462.77" dur="3.38">for error trying to line this up</text><text start="472.55" dur="10.35">oh ho I got it shoot I got it for just a</text><text start="476.33" dur="8.52">second it was really bright the camera</text><text start="482.9" dur="3.96">can see better than me in the dark you</text><text start="484.85" dur="5.94">know zoomed in over a long distance I</text><text start="486.86" dur="5.13">see it you see it isn&amp;#39;t that neat I told</text><text start="490.79" dur="3.3">you to be able to see it with your eye</text><text start="491.99" dur="5.64">the next thing that needs to happen is</text><text start="494.09" dur="5.13">to put the slotted wheel in the way of</text><text start="497.63" dur="2.82">this laser so I&amp;#39;m not going to touch the</text><text start="499.22" dur="2.61">laser I&amp;#39;m just going to line up the</text><text start="500.45" dur="4.68">wheel so that it gets in the way of the</text><text start="501.83" dur="6.36">beam all right wow that&amp;#39;s low I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="505.13" dur="4.83">glad I made it adjustable this is like</text><text start="508.19" dur="8.82">the actual

full of sand and water</text><text start="531.92" dur="4.2">that I filled up earlier so that once</text><text start="534.2" dur="5.46">this is spinning it&amp;#39;s not going to move</text><text

tonight okay Capra</text><text start="773.91" dur="3.33">wait until tomorrow evening I think that</text><text start="775.77" dur="9.15">I have all the data that I need I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="777.24" dur="9.69">pretty sure that this worked okay so</text><text start="784.92" dur="4.2">this is really cool a few days ago I</text><text start="786.93" dur="5.01">processed all of this data and I got a</text><text start="789.12" dur="5.61">value that was about 93% of the speed of</text><text start="791.94" dur="5.31">light which is good but it&amp;#39;s not really</text><text start="794.73" dur="4.44">as good as I was hoping for this morning</text><text start="797.25" dur="3.48">right before I decided to start filming</text><text start="799.17" dur="3.72">some of these pieces of the video I</text><text start="800.73" dur="4.2">realized that I forgot to stabilize the</text><text start="802.89" dur="3.72">footage so when the camera was getting</text><text start="804.93" dur="3.51">buffeted by wind while it was taking</text><text start="806.61" dur="4.29">data and shaking around by literally</text><text start="808.44" dur="5.37">just a couple of pixels that made a huge</text><text start="810.9" dur="4.89">difference so I got a much better result</text><text start="813.81" dur="3.36">now I&amp;#39;m gonna show you how I did it this</text><text start="815.79" dur="2.94">is one of the pictures that the camera</text><text start="817.17" dur="3.78">took well it was actually collecting</text><text start="818.73" dur="3.45">data and I&amp;#39;ve amped the exposure a</text><text start="820.95" dur="3.18">little bit so we can actually see the</text><text start="822.18" dur="3.45">cliff in the background but you can see</text><text start="824.13" dur="2.97">that the laser comes in from the side</text><text start="825.63" dur="3.75">because the camera and laser were next</text><text start="827.1" dur="4.62">to each other and it goes through the</text><text start="829.38" dur="4.83">aperture and spinning wheel assembly and</text><text start="831.72" dur="3.81">then you can see the cliff two miles</text><text start="834.21" dur="2.85">away out in the distance a little out of</text><text start="835.53" dur="2.82">focus in this picture but you can see</text><text start="837.06" dur="3.18">the cliff out in the distance and</text><text start="838.35" dur="3.84">there&amp;#39;s a brain green light on the edge</text><text start="840.24" dur="4.56">of the cliff and that bright green light</text><text start="842.19" dur="4.62">is the retroreflector so that bright</text><text start="844.8" dur="3.84">green light is light that has left the</text><text start="846.81" dur="4.74">laser going all the way to miles and has</text><text start="848.64" dur="5.22">come back the key is that we&amp;#39;re looking</text><text start="851.55" dur="4.74">at that light through the edge of this</text><text start="853.86" dur="4.29">disc so if we zoom in on that over here</text><text start="856.29" dur="4.65">you can see that there&amp;#39;s just these two</text><text start="858.15" dur="4.8">fringes of light that are coming through</text><text start="860.94" dur="3.87">the disc from that retro reflector</text><text start="862.95" dur="4.139">that&amp;#39;s the light that we care about for</text><text start="864.81" dur="5.13">analyzing this data what fa&amp;#39;sho</text><text start="867.089" dur="4.771">originally did was send this light back</text><text start="869.94" dur="3.72">through an aperture so that he was only</text><text start="871.86" dur="4.62">looking at light through one of these</text><text start="873.66" dur="4.77">slots so we can do that digitally very</text><text start="876.48" dur="3.63">easily in software i&amp;#39;ve amped the</text><text start="878.43" dur="4.14">contrast a little bit to make this more</text><text start="880.11" dur="4.02">obvious but you can see that in this gap</text><text start="882.57" dur="3.81">that we&amp;#39;ve left there&amp;#39;s a bright line</text><text start="884.13" dur="4.26">and that is light coming back through</text><text start="886.38" dur="3.84">the wheel from the reflected spot and</text><text start="888.39" dur="4.5">it&amp;#39;s said about in the wheels going</text><text start="890.22" dur="5.76">about 3000 rpm now if we make the wheel</text><text start="892.89" dur="5.46">go faster to something like 11 or 12,000</text><text start="895.98" dur="5.22">rpm we can see that that light actually</text><text start="898.35" dur="5.22">goes away it dims out and if we make the</text><text start="901.2" dur="5.34">wheel even faster and go up to something</text><text start="903.57" dur="5.22">like 19,000 rpm we can see that the</text><text start="906.54" dur="3.989">light comes back so this is exactly what</text><text start="908.79" dur="4.289">for Joe did he just took all of these</text><text start="910.529" dur="5.131">bright spot speeds and dark spot speeds</text><text start="913.079" dur="5.091">and plotted those out in order to figure</text><text start="915.66" dur="5.609">out how much of a speed difference</text><text start="918.17" dur="4.84">constituted the wheel moving one fringe</text><text start="921.269" dur="3.781">and you can use that to calculate the</text><text start="923.01" dur="3.87">speed of light however because we have</text><text start="925.05" dur="3.27">you know digital cameras and whatnot we</text><text start="926.88" dur="4.47">can be a little more precise than that</text><text start="928.32" dur="5.55">if we take away the aperture and just</text><text start="931.35" dur="4.229">look at the fringes we can see that they</text><text start="933.87" dur="4.32">actually look like they&amp;#39;re shifting very</text><text start="935.579" dur="5.491">slowly from side to side as the speed of</text><text start="938.19" dur="5.88">the wheel changes and that&amp;#39;s exactly</text><text start="941.07" dur="4.44">what&amp;#39;s happening because the time that</text><text start="944.07" dur="3.15">it takes for the light to go to the</text><text start="945.51" dur="4.29">cliff side and back always remains the</text><text start="947.22" dur="6.059">same but in that time the wheel has</text><text start="949.8" dur="5.46">turned just a little bit based on its</text><text start="953.279" dur="4.981">rotational speed so if the wheels going</text><text start="955.26" dur="4.74">really really fast then it will have</text><text start="958.26" dur="4.38">turned farther by the time the light</text><text start="960" dur="5.85">comes back and we can actually see</text><text start="962.64" dur="5.73">exactly how far that wheel has turned in</text><text start="965.85" dur="5.07">the round-trip of the light if we track</text><text start="968.37" dur="5.31">where these spots are in every single</text><text start="970.92" dur="4.8">image now you could open up a program</text><text start="973.68" dur="3.779">like image a here and just click in the</text><text start="975.72" dur="3.45">middle of every green spot to measure</text><text start="977.459" dur="5.041">its movement from image to image and</text><text start="979.17" dur="5.43">that would work but you know I have a</text><text start="982.5" dur="3.75">lot of scientific software laying around</text><text start="984.6" dur="4.229">so I decided to take it a little step</text><text start="986.25" dur="6.51">further and I actually took a line trace</text><text start="988.829" dur="5.76">across these fringes and used a peak</text><text start="992.76" dur="4.319">fitter in origin to precisely measure</text><text start="994.589" dur="5.641">the position of each green spot so after</text><text start="997.079" dur="6.541">I did that I plotted all of those spot</text><text start="1000.23" dur="4.51">positions versus wheel speed and I got</text><text start="1003.62" dur="3.4">this graph</text><text start="1004.74" dur="4.349">three lines because at most three green</text><text start="1007.02" dur="5.1">spots were visible at the same time as</text><text start="1009.089" dur="4.981">the wheel spins faster the spots appear</text><text start="1012.12" dur="4.589">to shift which is the they&amp;#39;re shifting</text><text start="1014.07" dur="4.98">in the y axis on this plot and once the</text><text start="1016.709" dur="5.07">spots have shifted by one entire spot</text><text start="1019.05" dur="5.22">spacing we know the round-trip time for</text><text start="1021.779" dur="5.04">the light is the exact same as the time</text><text start="1024.27" dur="5.25">that it takes for the wheel to move from</text><text start="1026.819" dur="4.921">where one slot is in the gap to where</text><text start="1029.52" dur="4.59">the next slot is in the gap and that is</text><text start="1031.74" dur="3.93">one 140th of a revolution because</text><text start="1034.11" dur="4.38">there&amp;#39;s a hundred and forty teeth on the</text><text start="1035.67" dur="5.34">wheel if I take these three lines and I</text><text start="1038.49" dur="5.099">crunch them into a single plot so that I</text><text start="1041.01" dur="5.49">can you know fit one line to them very</text><text start="1043.589" dur="5.191">nicely I can calculate a slope of that</text><text start="1046.5" dur="5.28">line and that slope is going to be in</text><text start="1048.78" dur="5.19">units of pixels per rpm which is a</text><text start="1051.78" dur="4.35">really bizarre unit but if you think</text><text start="1053.97" dur="4.44">that we already know that the average</text><text start="1056.13" dur="4.56">spacing between slots in the wheel is</text><text start="1058.41" dur="3.66">about seven point eight one pixels and I</text><text start="1060.69" dur="4.29">know that there are a hundred and forty</text><text start="1062.07" dur="6.21">slots per revolution of the disk then</text><text start="1064.98" dur="7.67">you can turn that pixels per rpm into a</text><text start="1068.28" dur="7.11">time and that time in this case is about</text><text start="1072.65" dur="5.71">three point four eight times ten to the</text><text start="1075.39" dur="4.98">minus seven minutes so if you convert</text><text start="1078.36" dur="4.98">that into you know some more useful</text><text start="1080.37" dur="5.79">units I guess that&amp;#39;s about twenty point</text><text start="1083.34" dur="5.31">nine microseconds and that is exactly</text><text start="1086.16" dur="4.44">how long it takes for the light to</text><text start="1088.65" dur="5.07">travel from the wheel to the reflector</text><text start="1090.6" dur="5.28">and back I know from my phone GPS and</text><text start="1093.72" dur="4.35">from Google Maps just you know tracing a</text><text start="1095.88" dur="3.72">line that the round-trip distance from</text><text start="1098.07" dur="3.96">where the wheel was to where the</text><text start="1099.6" dur="5.28">reflector was and back is about three</text><text start="1102.03" dur="5.61">point eight six miles so I can plug all</text><text start="1104.88" dur="6.48">of this into WolframAlpha and get a</text><text start="1107.64" dur="8.039">value of zero point one eight five miles</text><text start="1111.36" dur="5.9">per microsecond which is equal to 665</text><text start="1115.679" dur="4.941">million miles an hour</text><text start="1117.26" dur="6.61">298 million meters per second or about</text><text start="1120.62" dur="5.38">ninety-nine point three percent of the</text><text start="1123.87" dur="4.47">speed of light I&amp;#39;m pretty darn happy</text><text start="1126" dur="4.92">with myself for no beating physio at</text><text start="1128.34" dur="4.589">this measurement his original estimate</text><text start="1130.92" dur="3.57">was about five percent greater than the</text><text start="1132.929" dur="3.63">modern accepted value for the speed of</text><text start="1134.49" dur="3.66">light and my estimate that I just</text><text start="1136.559" dur="4.771">calculated here today</text><text start="1138.15" dur="4.92">is less than 1% lower than the modern</text><text start="1141.33" dur="4.65">accepted value for the speed of light</text><text start="1143.07" dur="4.41">now as a physics major I don&amp;#39;t know any</text><text start="1145.98" dur="3.48">physical constants more than one</text><text start="1147.48" dur="3.69">significant digit anyway as far as I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1149.46" dur="4.83">concerned the speed of light has always</text><text start="1151.17" dur="5.64">been 3/8 gravity&amp;#39;s been 10 and pi is</text><text start="1154.29" dur="4.56">close enough to 3 that nobody cares it</text><text start="1156.81" dur="4.53">feels like I have an unnecessary amount</text><text start="1158.85" dur="4.41">of precision in this experiment the</text><text start="1161.34" dur="3.42">error bar that I put on my data is just</text><text start="1163.26" dur="4.83">the standard error from the fit</text><text start="1164.76" dur="6.09">propagated through and that&amp;#39;s what like</text><text start="1168.09" dur="4.32">4% or something so it&amp;#39;s not that bad</text><text start="1170.85" dur="3.78">this is the first time that I&amp;#39;ve ever</text><text start="1172.41" dur="4.23">tried to you know recreate an experiment</text><text

did with none of the</text><text start="1182.22" dur="3.69">technology that I relied on the lasers</text><text start="1184.32" dur="4.8">you know the electronically controlled</text><text start="1185.91" dur="5.34">Dremel and the optical tachometers he</text><text start="1189.12" dur="4.29">had none of that he had some big like</text><text start="1191.25" dur="5.01">cranked clockwork

actually went through a lot of</text><text start="1210.15" dur="4.11">iteration before I got something that I</text><text start="1212.19" dur="4.2">even thought would come close to working</text><text
