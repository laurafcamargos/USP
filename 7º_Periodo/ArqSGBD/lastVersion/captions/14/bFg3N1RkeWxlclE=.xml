dur="5.919">planets well the first thing you need</text><text start="9.76" dur="4.16">are other planets going around our sun</text><text start="12.639" dur="3.961">are eight</text><text start="13.92" dur="5.4">planets uh plus Pluto and a bunch of</text><text start="16.6" dur="6.12">moons and lots of other stuff but it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="19.32" dur="5.959">small selection so your best bet is to</text><text start="22.72" dur="5.719">look for planets going around any and</text><text start="25.279" dur="5.92">all stars our galaxy alone has 100</text><text start="28.439" dur="4.681">billion stars in it and so there is a</text><text start="31.199" dur="4.281">lot of Hope of seeing an enormous amount</text><text start="33.12" dur="4.88">of planets as long as we have a way of</text><text start="35.48" dur="5.44">seeing them here are some ways you can</text><text start="38" dur="5.6">see planets going around other stars the</text><text start="40.92" dur="6.68">first is the transit method the transit</text><text start="43.6" dur="6.959">method is a method of seeing a planet by</text><text start="47.6" dur="5.759">watching for it block the light of the</text><text start="50.559" dur="5.281">star in other words if the planet is</text><text start="53.359" dur="5.401">reasonably big compared to the star when</text><text start="55.84" dur="5.359">it orbits the star it could get in our</text><text start="58.76" dur="5.759">way and we would see that the light from</text><text start="61.199" dur="5.561">the Star dims and then brightens again</text><text start="64.519" dur="4.521">with this very specific pattern which</text><text start="66.76" dur="4.999">would be caused by a planet transiting</text><text start="69.04" dur="4.719">in front of it and in fact at this point</text><text start="71.759" dur="4.36">thousands of planets going around other</text><text start="73.759" dur="5.72">stars have been seen using the transit</text><text start="76.119" dur="6.081">method a second method that people use</text><text start="79.479" dur="6.241">uh is a method basically looking for the</text><text start="82.2" dur="5.919">wobble of a star a planet like Jupiter</text><text start="85.72" dur="4.8">can be quite heavy even compared to the</text><text start="88.119" dur="5.121">star such that when it go goes around</text><text start="90.52" dur="5.4">the star the star wobbles and when it</text><text start="93.24" dur="4.919">wobbles towards and away from us it</text><text start="95.92" dur="4.12">shifts the frequency of light that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="98.159" dur="4.681">coming towards us it&amp;#39;s called a Doppler</text><text start="100.04" dur="6.28">shift and that Doppler shift happening</text><text start="102.84" dur="5.04">in a very regular pattern period uh</text><text start="106.32" dur="5">tells us that there&amp;#39;s something heavy</text><text start="107.88" dur="6.16">going around it a third way is if stars</text><text start="111.32" dur="6.119">and planets pass in between us and more</text><text start="114.04" dur="6.16">distant bright stars that passing can</text><text start="117.439" dur="4.72">cause the light uh to be warped a little</text><text start="120.2" dur="4.68">bit it&amp;#39;s called gravitational lensing</text><text start="122.159" dur="6.08">predicted by Einstein all these methods</text><text start="124.88" dur="5.32">and more are hopes uh for seeing</text><text start="128.239" dur="4.601">thousands tens of thousands even</text><text start="130.2" dur="6.64">hundreds of thousands of planets uh in</text><text start="132.84" dur="6.52">the near and immediate future uh but</text><text start="136.84" dur="4.479">then you want to figure out if there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="139.36" dur="5">life on any of those planets how are we</text><text start="141.319" dur="5.64">going to do that well the best bet is to</text><text start="144.36" dur="5.239">look at the atmosphere the atmosphere</text><text start="146.959" dur="4.321">will contain all kinds of chemicals and</text><text start="149.599" dur="3.681">those chemicals could have been</text><text start="151.28" dur="5">naturally there due to the formation of</text><text start="153.28" dur="4.4">the planet in the first place um or they</text><text start="156.28" dur="3.12">could be there because something</text><text start="157.68" dur="2.76">interesting is happening on the surface</text><text start="159.4" dur="4.6">of the</text><text start="160.44" dur="6.84">planet giant planets like Jupiter and</text><text start="164" dur="6.44">bigger uh naturally have water in their</text><text start="167.28" dur="5.599">atmospheres but tiny rocky planets</text><text start="170.44" dur="5.32">shouldn&amp;#39;t and they shouldn&amp;#39;t because</text><text start="172.879" dur="5.72">sunlight breaks apart water and hydrogen</text><text start="175.76" dur="6.88">is so light it wants to escape light</text><text start="178.599" dur="5.761">planets so look for small rocky planets</text><text start="182.64" dur="4.76">that have lots of water in their</text><text start="184.36" dur="4.68">atmosphere already that will suggest</text><text start="187.4" dur="4.839">that there is water on the surface of</text><text start="189.04" dur="5.24">the rocky planet like oceans it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="192.239" dur="4.441">prove there&amp;#39;s life on the planet but at</text><text start="194.28" dur="4.36">least now we&amp;#39;re getting more evidence</text><text start="196.68" dur="4.52">and we&amp;#39;re seeing ways of seeing planets</text><text start="198.64" dur="4.48">that look more and more like the earth a</text><text start="201.2" dur="3.88">final stage would be to look at that</text><text start="203.12" dur="5.24">atmosphere and find other things in the</text><text start="205.08" dur="6.4">atmosphere with abundances amounts that</text><text start="208.36" dur="5.48">are unexpected to occur simply naturally</text><text start="211.48" dur="4.6">one of those is for example oxygen</text><text start="213.84" dur="4.319">oxygen can be something which is</text><text start="216.08" dur="5.4">produced by living</text><text start="218.159" dur="6.121">organisms so if you look at a planet and</text><text start="221.48" dur="5.56">in its atmosphere there is water and</text><text start="224.28" dur="4.76">there&amp;#39;s large levels of oxygen and</text><text start="227.04" dur="4.36">perhaps other chemicals that we might</text><text start="229.04" dur="4.88">expect to be produced by the processes</text><text start="231.4" dur="5.24">of life then we start to have strong</text><text start="233.92" dur="5.159">evidence for the existence of life to</text><text start="236.64" dur="5.48">really go the final step you need really</text><text start="239.079" dur="6.08">provable theoretical models of what life</text><text start="242.12" dur="5.199">can and cannot do and what non-life</text><text start="245.159" dur="4.44">processes can do and put chemicals into</text><text start="247.319" dur="3.081">the atmospheres too how are we going to</text><text start="249.599" dur="4.28">be</text><text start="250.4" dur="5">sure we don&amp;#39;t know other than let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="253.879" dur="4.32">direct communication with the</text><text start="255.4" dur="5.359">intelligent beings out there however we</text><text start="258.199" dur="4.801">do see a path to get closer and closer</text><text start="260.759" dur="4.071">to eventually answering that question</text><text start="263" dur="8.899">are we alone</text><text
