we&amp;#39;ll get back</text><text start="9.28" dur="3.279">to later nickels weren&amp;#39;t known as</text><text start="10.96" dur="3.599">nickels then cuz nickels weren&amp;#39;t made of</text><text start="12.559" dur="4.241">nickel yet they started made of silver</text><text start="14.559" dur="4.8">mostly same as the 10-cent dime so this</text><text start="16.8" dur="4.239">5-cent coin was called the half dime but</text><text start="19.359" dur="3.361">two forces conspired to ensure the</text><text start="21.039" dur="3.761">protokeic wouldn&amp;#39;t stay made of silver</text><text start="22.72" dur="4.399">for long first the value of silver went</text><text start="24.8" dur="4.639">up and second inflation pushed buying</text><text start="27.119" dur="3.841">power down by civil war times the lines</text><text start="29.439" dur="3.761">crossed and the value of silver in the</text><text start="30.96" dur="4.48">5-cent coin was greater than 5 cents the</text><text start="33.2" dur="4">coins were worth more dead than alive so</text><text start="35.44" dur="3.68">people melted them to sell the silver at</text><text start="37.2" dur="3.679">a profit to stop this the mint switched</text><text start="39.12" dur="3.759">from making the coin with silver super</text><text start="40.879" dur="3.68">valuable to nickel not so much renamed</text><text start="42.879" dur="3.761">it the nickel to make it clear the new</text><text start="44.559" dur="4.721">coin wasn&amp;#39;t worth melting down and</text><text start="46.64" dur="4.72">everything was fine but only for a time</text><text start="49.28" dur="3.759">because again the value of the metal in</text><text start="51.36" dur="3.76">the coin continued to go up while</text><text start="53.039" dur="5.2">inflation pushed the buying power of 5</text><text start="55.12" dur="5.279">cents down way down for the next century</text><text start="58.239" dur="4.081">until a nickel was worth nearly nothing</text><text start="60.399" dur="3.76">compared to its silver start and thus</text><text start="62.32" dur="4.32">even the value of the nickel in the</text><text start="64.159" dur="4.401">nickel grew greater than 5 cents so</text><text start="66.64" dur="3.36">again people melted them down for profit</text><text start="68.56" dur="2.879">at this point in an economically</text><text start="70" dur="2.72">efficient world the story of the nickel</text><text start="71.439" dur="2.881">would have ended here with the</text><text start="72.72" dur="3.04">government realizing after two centuries</text><text start="74.32" dur="3.36">of inflation the coins weren&amp;#39;t worth</text><text start="75.76" dur="3.359">minting no more and happy its citizens</text><text start="77.68" dur="3.439">were profitably removing them from</text><text start="79.119" dur="3.841">circulation but instead the government</text><text start="81.119" dur="3.601">made melting US coins illegal and</text><text start="82.96" dur="4">continued to mint nickels at negative</text><text start="84.72" dur="4.24">value currently it takes 5 12 cents of</text><text start="86.96" dur="3.6">nickel to make a 5-cent nickel bad</text><text start="88.96" dur="3.36">enough but the cost of creating a coin</text><text start="90.56" dur="3.599">is not just in the metal to mint it but</text><text start="92.32" dur="3.759">also in running the mint to print it the</text><text start="94.159" dur="4.161">molds the machines the manpower the</text><text start="96.079" dur="4.08">management it all adds up to spending 14</text><text start="98.32" dur="4.56">cents to make a nickel and the</text><text start="100.159" dur="5.361">government makes 1.5 billion nickels a</text><text start="102.88" dur="6.08">year which doing the math creates $75</text><text start="105.52" dur="7.599">million of nickels at a cost of $210</text><text start="108.96" dur="6.479">million a loss of about $135 million a</text><text start="113.119" dur="5.28">year incurred by the government as it</text><text start="115.439" dur="5.441">literally prints money which if anything</text><text start="118.399" dur="5.121">should be profitable it&amp;#39;s printing money</text><text start="120.88" dur="5.04">so if you are losing money while this</text><text start="123.52" dur="5.28">cannot be emphasized enough literally</text><text start="125.92" dur="5.28">printing money you should literally stop</text><text start="128.8" dur="4.48">as with the 1 cent penny cost to make 2</text><text start="131.2" dur="4.16">cents if killing a coin because it loses</text><text start="133.28" dur="4.16">1 cent to make is a good idea than</text><text start="135.36" dur="4.72">killing the nickel which loses 9 cents</text><text start="137.44" dur="4.64">per coin is a better idea times nine and</text><text start="140.08" dur="3.92">it&amp;#39;s not just about saving money there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="142.08" dur="5.36">a better reason to get rid of the nickel</text><text start="144" dur="5.2">it&amp;#39;s no good at its only job being money</text><text start="147.44" dur="3.6">reminder governments print physical</text><text start="149.2" dur="3.92">money to make buying and selling stuff</text><text start="151.04" dur="4.479">with cash easy for their citizens that</text><text start="153.12" dur="5.04">at bare minimum requires each part of</text><text start="155.519" dur="4.481">that cash to be worth handling which</text><text start="158.16" dur="3.76">back in the olden days a nickel alone</text><text start="160" dur="4.319">was valuable enough to buy stuff on its</text><text start="161.92" dur="4.08">own nickelodeon is the oldtimey term for</text><text start="164.319" dur="3.681">a movie theater which got the name</text><text start="166" dur="4.879">because the price of entry was a nickel</text><text start="168" dur="5.44">but that is no more for sure now a</text><text start="170.879" dur="4.481">nickel buys you nothing vending machines</text><text start="173.44" dur="3.92">refuse to take them so there&amp;#39;s nowhere</text><text start="175.36" dur="4.48">to spend them leaving the nickels only</text><text start="177.36" dur="4.48">use for making exact change but the time</text><text start="179.84" dur="4">it takes to fiddle to find a 5-cent</text><text start="181.84" dur="4.24">piece in a pocket is probably net</text><text start="183.84" dur="4.8">negative and if there&amp;#39;s a line</text><text start="186.08" dur="5.28">guaranteed net negative on everyone&amp;#39;s</text><text start="188.64" dur="4.72">time so nickels have nothing going for</text><text start="191.36" dur="3.84">them they lose money in the making and</text><text start="193.36" dur="4.239">lose money in the handling making them</text><text start="195.2" dur="4.48">make no sense as money at all it&amp;#39;s time</text><text start="197.599" dur="4.081">to nyx the nickel but if you&amp;#39;re worried</text><text start="199.68" dur="4.479">cutting a coin could have consequences</text><text start="201.68" dur="4.479">don&amp;#39;t america has done this before the</text><text start="204.159" dur="4.241">mystery coin mentioned at the start that</text><text start="206.159" dur="4">was the half cent seen one lately of</text><text start="208.4" dur="4.479">course you haven&amp;#39;t it was discontinued</text><text start="210.159" dur="4.72">in 1857 for being worth too little to</text><text start="212.879" dur="3.92">bother with but when the half cent met</text><text start="214.879" dur="4.08">its fate it had more buying power than</text><text start="216.799" dur="4.72">today&amp;#39;s dime america seems to have</text><text start="218.959" dur="4.721">forgotten that it&amp;#39;s okay to stop making</text><text start="221.519" dur="3.681">coins when they&amp;#39;re no longer needed she</text><text start="223.68" dur="3.839">did it with the halfsent and she also</text><text start="225.2" dur="4.24">did it with the trime a three cent coin</text><text start="227.519" dur="3.681">you&amp;#39;ve also never seen because once it</text><text start="229.44" dur="3.84">solved the problems it was created to</text><text start="231.2" dur="4.64">solve that&amp;#39;s a whole other story america</text><text start="233.28" dur="4.64">simply stopped making them so if America</text><text start="235.84" dur="4.08">could stop making the chime and the half</text><text start="237.92" dur="4.16">cent without problem back then America</text><text start="239.92" dur="4.399">can stop making the half dime now too</text><text start="242.08" dur="4.4">nyx the nickel the only effect will be</text><text start="244.319" dur="4.801">rounding transactions to the nearest 10</text><text start="246.48" dur="7.16">simplifying the change saving time while</text><text start="249.12" dur="8.079">saving $135 million a year to do</text><text start="253.64" dur="5.48">so although if you think about it there</text><text start="257.199" dur="3.681">would be one little quirk with getting</text><text start="259.12" dur="4.16">rid of the nickel in a post penny</text><text start="260.88" dur="4.4">America for only the quarter and dime</text><text start="263.28" dur="3.76">would remain as common coins and</text><text start="265.28" dur="4.08">rounding cash transactions to the</text><text start="267.04" dur="4.879">nearest 10 would make spending a single</text><text start="269.36" dur="5.279">quarter or three quarters impossible for</text><text start="271.919" dur="4.801">they both end in five a ghost of nickels</text><text start="274.639" dur="4.721">past you could only actually spend</text><text start="276.72" dur="4.32">quarters two at a time very strange but</text><text start="279.36" dur="3.279">try to fix that by rounding to the</text><text start="281.04" dur="3.76">nearest five and that makes the amounts</text><text start="282.639" dur="4.881">under a quarter five and 15 also</text><text start="284.8" dur="5.36">impossible to pay so what to do there</text><text start="287.52" dur="4.72">are options too option the first is just</text><text start="290.16" dur="3.92">kill the quarter two and deal only with</text><text start="292.24" dur="3.6">dimes maybe bring back the half-dollar</text><text start="294.08" dur="3.76">nearly forgotten now as it&amp;#39;s minted in</text><text start="295.84" dur="3.84">amounts only for new mismatists with</text><text start="297.84" dur="4.56">those two coins all change could round</text><text start="299.68" dur="5.28">to 10 nice and tidy but boy would that</text><text start="302.4" dur="4.96">be annoying for the half-dollar is huge</text><text start="304.96" dur="4.239">and the dime tiny almost the smallest</text><text start="307.36" dur="3.92">coin ever minted with the exception of</text><text start="309.199" dur="4.56">the trime from before partly killed for</text><text start="311.28" dur="4.96">its annoying size not that far off from</text><text start="313.759" dur="4.401">the dime so option the second is to keep</text><text start="316.24" dur="4">the quarter not only is it the most</text><text start="318.16" dur="4.08">American of coins most countries divide</text><text start="320.24" dur="4.959">their money by fifths to get 20 not</text><text start="322.24" dur="5.2">fours to get 25 so America is by far the</text><text start="325.199" dur="3.84">biggest economy to have quarters and</text><text start="327.44" dur="3.44">quarters have gotten all the cool</text><text start="329.039" dur="4.561">designs probably because quarters are</text><text start="330.88" dur="5.039">obviously the most useful coin by far</text><text start="333.6" dur="4.48">still just valuable enough for some</text><text start="335.919" dur="4.56">small purchases and accepted by millions</text><text start="338.08" dur="4.399">of machines of all kinds it&amp;#39;s also the</text><text start="340.479" dur="4.16">most cost-effective coin to make so</text><text start="342.479" dur="4.72">money can be made literally making this</text><text start="344.639" dur="4.721">money how refreshing the quarter is</text><text start="347.199" dur="5.361">great so what if instead to straighten</text><text start="349.36" dur="5.92">out this strange change we for once try</text><text start="352.56" dur="5.199">to solve a problem before it&amp;#39;s a problem</text><text start="355.28" dur="4.16">and just ditch the dime ahead of its</text><text start="357.759" dur="3.521">time there&amp;#39;s no need to wait until</text><text start="359.44" dur="3.92">inflation drives the dime&amp;#39;s value down</text><text start="361.28" dur="4.479">until it&amp;#39;s not just worthless but worth</text><text start="363.36" dur="4.24">less than zero we can get ahead of the</text><text start="365.759" dur="4.401">inevitable and while ditching the penny</text><text start="367.6" dur="4.8">and nickel ditch the dime too keep only</text><text start="370.16" dur="5.12">the quarter and have the world&amp;#39;s best</text><text start="372.4" dur="5.04">most simple uniquely American change</text><text start="375.28" dur="4.72">system and if your final worry is that</text><text start="377.44" dur="4.4">rounding to 25 will be too big of a jump</text><text start="380" dur="4.08">again back when the penny was first</text><text start="381.84" dur="4.24">printed it had more buying power than</text><text start="384.08" dur="4.959">the quarter does today at a time when</text><text start="386.08" dur="5.52">all transactions had to be cash so if it</text><text start="389.039" dur="4.801">wasn&amp;#39;t a problem then it really
