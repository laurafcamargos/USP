dur="5.04">feel a headache why the nobo effect a</text><text start="42.52" dur="3.64">nobo is a harmless thing like a video</text><text start="44.52" dur="3.92">with non-existent hypers sounds that</text><text start="46.16" dur="4.16">causes harm like a headache because you</text><text start="48.44" dur="3.599">believe it&amp;#39;s harmful that sounds like</text><text start="50.32" dur="3.8">Voodoo but there&amp;#39;s real science behind</text><text start="52.039" dur="4.52">the nobo effect which is more than an</text><text start="54.12" dur="4.599">irritating parlor trick it causes real</text><text start="56.559" dur="3.64">problems like in medicine when testing a</text><text start="58.719" dur="3.081">new drug doctors get a group group of</text><text start="60.199" dur="3.641">sick people give half of them the new</text><text start="61.8" dur="4.04">drug and give the other half a fake pill</text><text start="63.84" dur="4.12">that does nothing but which they&amp;#39;re told</text><text start="65.84" dur="3.959">is real this is how science finds the</text><text start="67.96" dur="4.04">stuff that works amongst the junk that</text><text start="69.799" dur="3.841">doesn&amp;#39;t but new drugs have side effects</text><text start="72" dur="3.92">and sometimes patients drop out of the</text><text start="73.64" dur="5.08">experiment because of them no surprise</text><text start="75.92" dur="4.64">there but some people on the fake also</text><text start="78.72" dur="3.359">drop out from the side effects side</text><text start="80.56" dur="3.519">effects they&amp;#39;ve gotten from a drug they</text><text start="82.079" dur="3.68">aren&amp;#39;t taking but because they think</text><text start="84.079" dur="4">they&amp;#39;re on the real thing they&amp;#39;ve also</text><text start="85.759" dur="3.561">thought themselves into the side effects</text><text start="88.079" dur="3.08">now maybe this is just a case of</text><text start="89.32" dur="3.32">misattribution tion people get headaches</text><text start="91.159" dur="3">and if they&amp;#39;ve joined a drug trial that</text><text start="92.64" dur="3.519">lists headaches and the side effects</text><text start="94.159" dur="3.96">it&amp;#39;s natural to blame the new drug and</text><text start="96.159" dur="3.801">that certainly happens to some extent</text><text start="98.119" dur="4.28">but the nobo effect is more than just</text><text start="99.96" dur="4.199">misattribution it causes real additional</text><text start="102.399" dur="4.121">harm that scientists can measure in</text><text start="104.159" dur="3.681">Cruel Cruel experiments and this is one</text><text start="106.52" dur="3.44">of the reasons there&amp;#39;s not

with an experiment designed</text><text start="112.96" dur="4.159">to hurt people and they&amp;#39;ll frown on that</text><text start="115.36" dur="3.52">but sometimes nobo experiments do get</text><text start="117.119" dur="3.801">approved to the benefit of Science and</text><text start="118.88" dur="3.64">Humanity if not the participants for</text><text start="120.92" dur="3.199">example under the right conditions some</text><text start="122.52" dur="3.4">people who expect a harmless injection</text><text start="124.119" dur="3.401">will give them a rash will get a rash</text><text start="125.92" dur="4.24">but for people who expect nothing to</text><text start="127.52" dur="4.56">happen nothing is exactly what happens</text><text start="130.16" dur="3.84">and fake pills can be addictive take</text><text start="132.08" dur="4.36">test subjects off pills they believe are</text><text start="134" dur="4.239">addictive and some will experience noic</text><text start="136.44" dur="3.84">withdrawal symptoms like pain and</text><text start="138.239" dur="3.921">fatigue from pills they could never have</text><text start="140.28" dur="3.56">been addicted to in the first place</text><text start="142.16" dur="3.359">another experiment gave people harmless</text><text start="143.84" dur="3.24">injections told half of them to sit</text><text start="145.519" dur="3.44">there and told the other half their pain</text><text start="147.08" dur="4">would increase for the next 30 minutes</text><text start="148.959" dur="4.201">which it did but in this situation</text><text start="151.08" dur="3.68">there&amp;#39;s a drug that can block the nobo</text><text start="153.16" dur="3.68">effect and those who were told the</text><text start="154.76" dur="4.52">injection would hurt but were also</text><text start="156.84" dur="4.679">secretly given a nobo blocking drug did</text><text start="159.28" dur="4.52">not report an increase in pain showing</text><text start="161.519" dur="4.481">that the nobo effect is a real physical</text><text start="163.8" dur="4.28">process in all these nobo experiments</text><text start="166" dur="3.72">it&amp;#39;s the belief in harm that matters if</text><text start="168.08" dur="3.32">someone dressed as a voodoo which doctor</text><text start="169.72" dur="4.08">popped up and hexed you with a curse of</text><text start="171.4" dur="4.44">great pain no effect but in a room with</text><text start="173.8" dur="3.799">a real doctor and his clipboard and a</text><text start="175.84" dur="3.6">big science machine and a needle in your</text><text start="177.599" dur="3.681">arm you&amp;#39;ll take his words rather more</text><text start="179.44" dur="4.48">serious serously which is why doctors</text><text start="181.28" dur="5.36">say this won&amp;#39;t hurt a bit rather than oh</text><text start="183.92" dur="4.8">this it&amp;#39;s going to hurt like a lot which</text><text start="186.64" dur="4.599">by the way was a real experiment done on</text><text start="188.72" dur="4.799">women undergoing labor during spinal</text><text start="191.239" dur="4.481">injections guess how that turned out but</text><text start="193.519" dur="3.881">nobos don&amp;#39;t end here while illnesses</text><text start="195.72" dur="3.84">like the flu spread from contact with</text><text

someone</text><text start="235.64" dur="4.48">else when this happens it&amp;#39;s called Mass</text><text start="238.079" dur="3.88">psychogenic illness the treatment in</text><text start="240.12" dur="3.8">these cases is to separate those with</text><text start="241.959" dur="4.2">symptoms from the rest and reassure the</text><text start="243.92" dur="4.159">ill that yes their symptoms are real but</text><text start="246.159" dur="4.321">no they haven&amp;#39;t been exposed to anything</text><text start="248.079" dur="3.961">toxic and yes people are getting better</text><text
