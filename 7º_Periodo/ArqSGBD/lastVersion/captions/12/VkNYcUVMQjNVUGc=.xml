dur="6.961">Tails</text><text start="265.88" dur="4">heads heads</text><text start="270.32" dur="5.8">heads so we got one tails and three</text><text start="273.639" dur="5.521">heads that&amp;#39;s

start="283.479" dur="4.56">well I don&amp;#39;t have 16 fingers two to the</text><text start="285.479" dur="4.401">four There are 16 possible outcomes and</text><text start="288.039" dur="3.801">each

to</text><text start="294.639" dur="4.041">get all heads there are four outcomes</text><text start="296.919" dur="3.84">where one coin is Tails and three coins</text><text start="298.68" dur="3.72">are heads there are four outcomes where</text><text start="300.759" dur="3.761">one coin is heads and three coins are</text><text start="302.4" dur="4.239">tails and there are a whopping six</text><text start="304.52" dur="3.959">different ways to flip four coins and</text><text start="306.639" dur="5.041">have two of them come up heads when you</text><text start="308.479" dur="4.641">flip four coins the most likely outcome</text><text start="311.68" dur="3.16">is that two of them will be heads and</text><text start="313.12" dur="3.76">two of them will be tails you don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="314.84" dur="4.079">which two of the coins will be heads and</text><text start="316.88" dur="4.72">tails but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter you have a</text><text start="318.919" dur="4.441">six out of 16 chance of selecting one of</text><text start="321.6" dur="3.76">these states I&amp;#39;m holding off the rigor</text><text start="323.36" dur="4.279">here for a few minutes thermodynamic and</text><text start="325.36" dur="4.44">the audience don&amp;#39;t get mad I&amp;#39;ll fix it</text><text start="327.639" dur="4.56">but for now let&amp;#39;s say that the entropy</text><text start="329.8" dur="5.36">of this system is four the likelihood</text><text start="332.199" dur="6.84">out of 16 of getting three heads and one</text><text start="335.16" dur="3.879">Tails if I flip all these coins</text><text start="343.56" dur="4.24">again now we got two heads and two taals</text><text start="346.319" dur="3.401">which conveniently is the same thing</text><text start="347.8" dur="4.519">that I wrote In The</text><text start="349.72" dur="4.319">Script the entropy of this system has</text><text start="352.319" dur="4.801">changed the entropy of this system is</text><text start="354.039" dur="5.16">now six because there are six out of 16</text><text start="357.12" dur="4.48">possibilities that give us two heads and</text><text start="359.199" dur="4.041">two tails entropy is not a conserved</text><text start="361.6" dur="3.56">quantity there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with me</text><text start="363.24" dur="4.04">re flipping the coins and saying oh the</text><text start="365.16" dur="4.08">entropy is different now you can keep</text><text start="367.28" dur="4.08">flipping the coins and keep updating the</text><text start="369.24" dur="5.56">system and the entropy will keep</text><text start="371.36" dur="5.72">changing so now let&amp;#39;s upgrade to 10</text><text start="374.8" dur="4.959">coins this means I need to expand my</text><text start="377.08" dur="4.519">spreadsheet because now there are 1,24</text><text start="379.759" dur="4.56">different outcomes for this experiment</text><text start="381.599" dur="4.88">but only 10 possibilities for the sum we</text><text start="384.319" dur="4.521">can&amp;#39;t flip 10 coins and get more than 10</text><text start="386.479" dur="5.12">heads so now our distribution looks like</text><text start="388.84" dur="4.96">this surprisingly the most likely</text><text start="391.599" dur="4.201">outcome for flipping 10 coins is seeing</text><text start="393.8" dur="2.76">five of them turn up heads in fact there</text><text start="395.8" dur="4.04">are</text><text start="396.56" dur="4.88">252 different ways for that to happen</text><text start="399.84" dur="4.04">but what about a situation where only</text><text start="401.44" dur="5">one coin is heads of course because any</text><text start="403.88" dur="4.759">of the 10 coins could be that one there</text><text start="406.44" dur="4.199">are 10 different ways for that to happen</text><text start="408.639" dur="5.481">if we&amp;#39;ve got 10 coins this one could be</text><text start="410.639" dur="5.041">heads or this one could be heads or this</text><text start="414.12" dur="3.199">one could be heads there are 10</text><text start="415.68" dur="2.76">different ways for that to happen</text><text start="417.319" dur="2.88">another way to think about it is</text><text start="418.44" dur="3.56">permutation so instead of flipping them</text><text start="420.199" dur="4.321">you can go well you know that one could</text><text start="422" dur="4.24">be heads or that one could be heads and</text><text start="424.52" dur="3.119">the rearranging definition is going to</text><text start="426.24" dur="3.6">be the one that&amp;#39;s a little more relevant</text><text start="427.639" dur="3.481">for mixing but mathematically they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="429.84" dur="3.799">equivalent you can just keep flipping</text><text start="431.12" dur="5.32">coins entropy is commonly referred to as</text><text start="433.639" dur="5.4">disorder or Randomness but these terms</text><text start="436.44" dur="4.08">are pretty biased by our human intuition</text><text start="439.039" dur="4.72">for what it means for something to be</text><text start="440.52" dur="5.48">sorted or ordered out of these 104</text><text start="443.759" dur="4.761">possible Arrangements of coin flips</text><text start="446" dur="5.36">which of these feels more likely to you</text><text start="448.52" dur="5.2">all tals or heads Heads Tails heads</text><text start="451.36" dur="5.6">Tails heads heads Heads Tails Tails I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="453.72" dur="3.24">give you an intermission to think about</text><text start="459.319" dur="5">it that&amp;#39;s a trick question both of these</text><text start="462.12" dur="5.56">patterns are equally likely you could</text><text start="464.319" dur="5.361">flip coins for a very long time and not</text><text start="467.68" dur="3.56">flip 10 coins and

dur="4.4">one humans like to see patterns and that</text><text start="496.319" dur="4.801">has led us to this definition of entropy</text><text start="498.319" dur="4.921">where stuff like this is said to be</text><text start="501.12" dur="4.519">disordered or to have a lot of entropy</text><text start="503.24" dur="4.56">the way we quantify this is to add up</text><text start="505.639" dur="4.321">the results in this particular case we</text><text start="507.8" dur="5.679">have a sequence with six heads and Four</text><text start="509.96" dur="5.28">Tails there are 210 different ways that</text><text start="513.479" dur="3.761">we could have flipped 10 coins and</text><text start="515.24" dur="4.96">gotten six heads and four tails but</text><text start="517.24" dur="5.64">there is only one way to flip 10 coins</text><text start="520.2" dur="4.88">and get all Tails this pattern has more</text><text start="522.88" dur="4.44">entropy because there are more ways

of one more ball takes that</text><text start="1154.48" dur="5.92">all the way up to 330 so at this point</text><text start="1157.679" dur="4.561">through excruciating counting we have</text><text

dur="4.12">wondering how this script got so bloated</text><text start="1433.36" dur="4.64">and where&amp;#39;s the ink machine again so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1435.52" dur="4.519">sorry but

start="1452.24" dur="4.319">but I didn&amp;#39;t talk about the most</text><text start="1453.76" dur="5.84">interesting part the title on the front</text><text start="1456.559" dur="5.681">here I wrote entropy of mixing and that</text><text start="1459.6" dur="5.48">is the increase in entropy that results</text><text start="1462.24" dur="4.4">from combining ink and water in this way</text><text start="1465.08" dur="4.44">and the coolest part of this entire</text><text start="1466.64" dur="5.159">project is that it happens in Reverse</text><text start="1469.52" dur="4.68">I&amp;#39;m actually separating the ink and</text><text start="1471.799" dur="3.801">water so that we can mix them again</text><text start="1474.2" dur="3.719">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening inside this</text><text start="1475.6" dur="4.76">filter cartridge at an extremely high</text><text start="1477.919" dur="5.321">pressure ink and water are going in at</text><text start="1480.36" dur="5.36">about 100 PSI and pure water is coming</text><text start="1483.24" dur="4.919">out the other side so how does this work</text><text start="1485.72" dur="5.24">well in this demo I did earlier we took</text><text start="1488.159" dur="4.441">pure water and mixed it with sugar water</text><text start="1490.96" dur="4.12">and we saw that through the process of</text><text start="1492.6" dur="5.88">osmosis this system was actually able to</text><text start="1495.08" dur="5.8">do work by increasing entropy we were</text><text start="1498.48" dur="5">mixing two substances together creating</text><text start="1500.88" dur="4.799">entropy and from that actually</text><text start="1503.48" dur="4.52">extracting energy in the form of</text><text start="1505.679" dur="4.681">pressurized water that could lift to a</text><text start="1508" dur="4.64">higher height Against Gravity if in this</text><text start="1510.36" dur="4.799">example we were able to put like high</text><text start="1512.64" dur="4.68">pressure air or something into this tube</text><text start="1515.159" dur="5">we could actually back drive this entire</text><text start="1517.32" dur="5.479">system we could force water and sugar to</text><text start="1520.159" dur="4.801">separate through this membrane giving us</text><text start="1522.799" dur="3.721">pure water on the other side the side</text><text start="1524.96" dur="3.8">effects here is that we can&amp;#39;t actually</text><text start="1526.52" dur="4.08">get rid of the sugar so the the mixture</text><text start="1528.76" dur="4.279">in this tube would get progressively</text><text start="1530.6" dur="6.28">more concentrated we&amp;#39;d effectively be</text><text start="1533.039" dur="6.041">squeezing pure water out of like syrup</text><text start="1536.88" dur="4.44">and when we do this we would be sorting</text><text start="1539.08" dur="3.92">the system we would be decreasing its</text><text start="1541.32" dur="3.44">entropy putting all the water on one</text><text start="1543" dur="4.32">side and all the sugar on the other side</text><text start="1544.76" dur="5.159">and we can&amp;#39;t do that unless we expend</text><text start="1547.32" dur="4.28">energy from outside the system and</text><text start="1549.919" dur="3.961">that&amp;#39;s exactly what this pump is doing</text><text start="1551.6" dur="4.679">inside the ink machine it&amp;#39;s injecting</text><text start="1553.88" dur="5.919">useful energy or thermodynamic free</text><text start="1556.279" dur="6">energy into the ink water filter system</text><text start="1559.799" dur="4.801">to sort it more mechanistically this big</text><text start="1562.279" dur="4.201">beefy pump is just shoving an ink water</text><text start="1564.6" dur="4.679">mixture at high pressure into this</text><text start="1566.48" dur="5.439">filter the water goes through and what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1569.279" dur="5.681">left over concentrates into almost pure</text><text start="1571.919" dur="5.841">ink so we&amp;#39;re basically squeezing water</text><text start="1574.96" dur="5.439">out

as</text><text start="1583" dur="5">we just spent way too long calculating</text><text start="1585.24" dur="4.64">we have to expend energy to do this by</text><text start="1588" dur="4.2">St
