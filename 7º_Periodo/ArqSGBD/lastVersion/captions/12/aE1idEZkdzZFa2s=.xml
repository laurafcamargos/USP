dur="3.961">radio astronomy is that we are able to</text><text start="34.38" dur="3.839">you know quote unquote see the universe</text><text start="36.36" dur="4.44">in ways that we cannot see with our own</text><text start="38.219" dur="5.221">eyes if you pick a particular frequency</text><text start="40.8" dur="4.919">is you know lower than 1420 megahertz</text><text start="43.44"

its</text><text start="49.32" dur="3.84">life in the Big Bang which happened</text><text start="50.82" dur="4.739">about 14 billion years ago that time the</text><text start="53.16" dur="4.32">universe was very hot and very dense as</text><text start="55.559" dur="3.421">the universe has expanded and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="57.48" dur="3.12">cooled down it&amp;#39;s transitioned through</text><text start="58.98" dur="3.66">different phases</text><text start="60.6" dur="4.68">hydrogen is a very special tool for us</text><text start="62.64" dur="4.38">in cosmology and the reason why we rely</text><text start="65.28" dur="3.36">on it so heavily is because it&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="67.02" dur="3.779">most abundant element in the universe</text><text start="68.64" dur="4.92">and hydrogen is special because it</text><text start="70.799" dur="4.68">naturally glows with radio light and we</text><text start="73.56" dur="3.3">can use this emission of hydrogen to</text><text start="75.479" dur="2.341">kind of map out where it is in the</text><text start="76.86" dur="3.42">universe</text><text start="77.82" dur="3.96">anytime you look at any object with a</text><text start="80.28" dur="3.9">telescope you&amp;#39;re kind of seeing that</text><text start="81.78" dur="4.68">object in the past because the universe</text><text start="84.18" dur="4.439">is expanding the light from the hydrogen</text><text start="86.46" dur="4.38">is stretched out or redshifted in</text><text start="88.619" dur="4.081">proportion to how far away the hydrogen</text><text start="90.84" dur="4.139">is or equivalently how long ago the</text><text start="92.7" dur="4.2">light was emitted so the way we can use</text><text start="94.979" dur="3.841">radio telescopes to kind of peer back in</text><text start="96.9" dur="4.44">time and map out the history of the</text><text start="98.82" dur="4.28">universe is by measuring this

a</text><text start="109.439" dur="3.601">radio telescope is something to receive</text><text start="111.06" dur="3.839">the light and so depending on what kind</text><text start="113.04" dur="4.02">of instrument you&amp;#39;re building that can</text><text start="114.899" dur="4.141">either be a reflector like a dish of</text><text start="117.06" dur="5.16">some sort that gathers light and then</text><text start="119.04" dur="4.74">focuses it onto a receiver or sometimes</text><text start="122.22" dur="3.84">in our experiments we just have bare</text><text start="123.78" dur="4.44">antennas that sit and look at the sky we</text><text start="126.06" dur="3.66">have to bring it down</text><text start="128.22" dur="3.599">the radio signals that we&amp;#39;re looking for</text><text start="129.72" dur="4.08">are typically very faint and so</text><text start="131.819" dur="3.42">immediately after you receive that</text><text start="133.8" dur="3.96">radiation the first thing that you want</text><text start="135.239" dur="4.261">to do is amplify it</text><text start="137.76" dur="3.72">and then there&amp;#39;s usually digitizing</text><text start="139.5" dur="3.66">electronics that turn those analog</text><text start="141.48" dur="4.46">signals from the telescope into numbers</text><text start="143.16" dur="6.2">that then we can put on the computer</text><text start="145.94" dur="3.42">all right go ahead</text><text start="149.78" dur="5.02">the reward in doing this work is that by</text><text start="153" dur="3.48">knowing the science and the kinds of</text><text start="154.8" dur="3.659">things that you have to measure that</text><text start="156.48" dur="3.36">informs our design so that we&amp;#39;re able to</text><text start="158.459" dur="3">build a machine that&amp;#39;s specifically</text><text start="159.84" dur="3.78">targeting our goals and then we can</text><text start="161.459" dur="3.661">optimize it to our hearts content</text><text start="163.62" dur="3">it&amp;#39;s going to take off climb to 50 feet</text><text start="165.12" dur="3.42">and then hover over the antenna okay</text><text start="166.62" dur="3.54">then we&amp;#39;ll run configure PGA perfect</text><text start="168.54" dur="5">we&amp;#39;ll start up dump base band dump</text><text start="170.16" dur="3.38">spectro and send it up to five pack</text><text start="175.92" dur="3.78">one of the greatest challenges of</text><text start="177.9" dur="3.72">observing in the radio is that there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="179.7" dur="4.8">all sorts of interference at Radio</text><text start="181.62" dur="6.119">wavelengths created by humans FM radio</text><text start="184.5" dur="5.459">AM radio TV towers cell phone towers all</text><text start="187.739" dur="4.08">sorts of stuff so we often end up in</text><text start="189.959" dur="4.081">kind of strange places out in the middle</text><text start="191.819" dur="4.261">of nowhere where it&amp;#39;s you know quite</text><text start="194.04" dur="4.14">literally quiet radio quiet so that we</text><text start="196.08" dur="4.14">can get a better view of the sky</text><text start="198.18" dur="3.9">the most recent sites that I&amp;#39;ve worked</text><text start="200.22" dur="4.68">at are in the high arctic Northern</text><text start="202.08" dur="4.739">Canada and also Marion Island which is</text><text start="204.9" dur="3.66">an island in the sub Antarctic it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="206.819" dur="3.961">located about halfway between South</text><text start="208.56" dur="3.5">Africa and Antarctica it&amp;#39;s about 2 000</text><text start="210.78" dur="4.08">kilometers away from anything else</text><text start="212.06" dur="5.02">Marion is windy and it&amp;#39;s rainy and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="214.86" dur="4.519">cold year round the winds are especially</text><text start="217.08" dur="2.299">bad</text><text start="222.319" dur="5.381">my team has two experiments that ran</text><text start="225.18" dur="4.32">from Marion Island and one of them prism</text><text start="227.7" dur="3.66">was designed to be a cosmic Dawn</text><text start="229.5" dur="3.239">experiment so specifically looking for</text><text start="231.36" dur="3.06">the signature of the first Stars</text><text start="232.739" dur="3.42">eliminating in the universe roughly</text><text start="234.42" dur="4.02">about 100 million years after the big</text><text start="236.159" dur="4.021">bang it&amp;#39;s exciting to study because we</text><text start="238.44" dur="4.379">basically have no measurements of this</text><text start="240.18" dur="4.38">period the experiment consists of two</text><text start="242.819" dur="4.621">antennas each about the size of a coffee</text><text start="244.56" dur="5.459">table the way the prism antennas work is</text><text start="247.44" dur="4.379">that they are basically a very sensitive</text><text start="250.019" dur="3.72">thermometers or microphones as you can</text><text start="251.819" dur="4.14">think about it they just kind of measure</text><text start="253.739" dur="3.481">the average intensity across the entire</text><text start="255.959" dur="4.201">sky so we&amp;#39;re not trying to make pictures</text><text start="257.22" dur="4.919">with these antennas the frequencies that</text><text start="260.16" dur="5.099">we&amp;#39;re looking at from cosmic Dawn are</text><text start="262.139" dur="5.12">actually exactly FM radio that plus a</text><text start="265.259" dur="4.38">little bit more so if you can imagine</text><text start="267.259" dur="4.361">tuning into all of the radio stations at</text><text start="269.639" dur="3.301">the same time with your car radio what</text><text start="271.62" dur="3.06">we&amp;#39;re listening for is kind of the</text><text start="272.94" dur="3.539">static from the early universe but</text><text start="274.68" dur="3.84">within that static buried deep within</text><text start="276.479" dur="4.261">there for a few of those radio stations</text><text start="278.52" dur="4.58">we&amp;#39;re listening for where the static is</text><text start="280.74" dur="2.36">a little quieter</text><text start="284.34" dur="3.78">[Music]</text><text start="285.9" dur="5.16">the other experiment that we have set up</text><text start="288.12" dur="5.579">is an interferometer that is trying to</text><text

this glowing</text><text start="309.78" dur="5.28">ionized plasma and became transparent</text><text start="312.479" dur="4.5">light was created at this point known as</text><text start="315.06"

throughout the dark ages one of</text><text start="340.44" dur="3.9">the very exciting things is that if we</text><text start="342.3" dur="4.32">could one day map out that distribution</text><text start="344.34" dur="3.78">of hydrogen in full three dimensions we</text><text start="346.62" dur="2.82">could learn you know a huge amount about</text><text start="348.12" dur="3.6">our
