I&amp;#39;m happy to do because my next</text><text start="24.599" dur="3.08">week video was delayed by pestilence</text><text start="26.359" dur="2.92">which struck me down into the depths of</text><text start="27.679" dur="3.321">unproductive misery for the last few</text><text start="29.279" dur="3.081">weeks so if you haven&amp;#39;t already please</text><text start="31"

Corrections</text><text start="34.8" dur="3.2">I&amp;#39;d like to make the first of these is</text><text start="36.559" dur="3.401">that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have called the Mayans</text><text start="38" dur="3.44">Mayans Maya is the correct singular and</text><text start="39.96" dur="3.52">plural noun to use in the same way that</text><text start="41.44" dur="3.2">sheep is both singular and plural Mayan</text><text start="43.48" dur="2.64">is the name of the language and the</text><text start="44.64" dur="3.559">adjective form of the word as in the</text><text start="46.12" dur="3.48">mine civilization secondly I showed a</text><text start="48.199" dur="3.161">picture of the Aztec calendar Stone</text><text start="49.6" dur="3.2">rather than a mine calendar in my 2012</text><text start="51.36" dur="3.039">video which at the time I thought was</text><text start="52.8" dur="3.279">okay because the Aztec calender is the</text><text start="54.399" dur="3.281">same as the mine just with different</text><text start="56.079" dur="3.841">names sort of like the Greek and Roman</text><text start="57.68" dur="3.76">gods and frankly the Aztec one is much</text><text start="59.92" dur="3.2">much cooler looking but I was still</text><text start="61.44" dur="3.759">wrong to show it because despite naming</text><text start="63.12" dur="4.039">it the AA calendar Stone archaeologists</text><text start="65.199" dur="3.641">don&amp;#39;t actually think it&amp;#39;s a calendar and</text><text start="67.159" dur="3.401">speaking of stone I use the term Stone</text><text

dur="3.36">Corrections it&amp;#39;s explanation time for</text><text start="86.72" dur="4">this image which raises three questions</text><text start="88.64" dur="3.88">one does the M calendar have leap days</text><text start="90.72" dur="3.079">two did the Maya miscount the years</text><text start="92.52" dur="3.68">three should the world have already</text><text start="93.799" dur="4.201">ended the answer to all of these is no</text><text start="96.2" dur="3.16">to briefly recap leap years exist to</text><text start="98" dur="2.88">stop Seasons drifting out of sync with</text><text start="99.36" dur="3.039">the calendar a problem that Vex Pope</text><text start="100.88" dur="3.64">Gregory because every year Easter and</text><text start="102.399" dur="3.481">spring were getting further apart to fix</text><text start="104.52" dur="3.08">this he introduced the modestly named</text><text start="105.88" dur="3.199">gorian calendar with its fancy leape</text><text start="107.6" dur="3.36">rules to keep the seasons and thus the</text><text start="109.079" dur="3.64">holidays together but while Pope Gregory</text><text start="110.96" dur="3.36">cared about the seasons the ancient Maya</text><text start="112.719" dur="3.201">did not presumably because where they</text><text start="114.32" dur="4.2">lived the weather comes in only one</text><text start="115.92" dur="4.32">season too hot and too humid so the</text><text start="118.52" dur="3.16">Mayan calendar ignores seasons in favor</text><text start="120.24" dur="3.04">of accurately tracking the days since</text><text start="121.68" dur="3.16">Creation in the Mayan religion this</text><text start="123.28" dur="3.28">renders leap years an unnecessary</text><text start="124.84" dur="3.32">complication though the Mayan calendar</text><text start="126.56" dur="3.199">is no stranger to complication with it</text><text start="128.16" dur="3.24">Cycles within

dur="2.84">transported Pope Gregory a thousand</text><text start="145.519" dur="2.841">years back in time to meet the May and</text><text start="146.92" dur="3">Lady Shook and then made them count the</text><text start="148.36" dur="2.84">days until this year&amp;#39;s winter solstice</text><text start="149.92" dur="3.2">they&amp;#39;d agree on that number because</text><text start="151.2" dur="3.52">they&amp;#39;re just counting sunrises it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="153.12" dur="3.399">like Pope Gregory with his clever modern</text><text start="154.72" dur="3.48">calendar would notice 500 plus days that</text><text start="156.519" dur="3.121">the lady shoke somehow missed perhaps</text><text start="158.2" dur="3.24">while distracted by the pain from her</text><text
