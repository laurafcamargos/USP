<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.24" dur="4.11">the fascinating thing that I&amp;#39;ve always</text><text start="2.46" dur="5.25">found about physics is that it studies</text><text start="4.35" dur="6.36">collections of objects and what they do</text><text start="7.71" dur="7.559">together like water can suddenly freeze</text><text start="10.71" dur="6.81">or water can boil now that&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="15.269" dur="4.111">interesting and you think that there has</text><text start="17.52" dur="3.66">nothing to do with people other than</text><text start="19.38" dur="5.22">that people are studying it but people</text><text start="21.18" dur="6.87">are like particles people get together</text><text start="24.6" dur="6.839">on a road they form traffic jams which</text><text start="28.05" dur="5.31">is like something solidifying they get</text><text start="31.439" dur="4.53">together into groups which is very much</text><text start="33.36" dur="5.01">like particles do and so the question</text><text start="35.969" dur="4.291">arises can you ever come up with a kind</text><text start="38.37" dur="3.99">of mathematics that is like the</text><text start="40.26" dur="4.799">mathematics used for physics but</text><text start="42.36" dur="5.16">describes collections of people now</text><text start="45.059" dur="6.211">immediately there&amp;#39;s the objection wait a</text><text start="47.52" dur="4.89">minute people have free will and people</text><text start="51.27" dur="3.51">are very different we&amp;#39;re all very</text><text start="52.41" dur="4.26">different we&amp;#39;re not like particles but</text><text start="54.78" dur="3.959">something interesting happens because</text><text start="56.67" dur="4.26">when we have lots of objects it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="58.739" dur="5.07">really matter that one or two or three</text><text start="60.93" dur="4.979">or all of them are individually free</text><text start="63.809" dur="4.201">well they collectively they will act</text><text start="65.909" dur="5.221">together as a group and that group has</text><text start="68.01" dur="5.1">actually some predictability 3-inch C if</text><text start="71.13" dur="5.04">I think if these coins if I flip a coin</text><text start="73.11" dur="5.73">I&amp;#39;ll get heads or tails with 50%</text><text start="76.17" dur="6.05">probability so the chance of me flipping</text><text start="78.84" dur="6.959">say ten coins and getting ten heads is</text><text start="82.22" dur="6.31">well it&amp;#39;s just really unlikely but when</text><text start="85.799" dur="4.981">it comes to people the chances of having</text><text start="88.53" dur="3.81">people all suddenly appear on the road</text><text start="90.78" dur="2.79">at the same time of the day and cause a</text><text start="92.34" dur="4.169">traffic jam is actually quite</text><text start="93.57" dur="5.4">predictable it&amp;#39;s also the same with for</text><text start="96.509" dur="5.761">example stock market stock markets crash</text><text start="98.97" dur="5.37">and they rise again much quicker and</text><text start="102.27" dur="5.73">much more often than you&amp;#39;d expect if you</text><text start="104.34" dur="7.709">were just flipping coins and so the big</text><text start="108" dur="8.43">question arises is can we describe how</text><text start="112.049" dur="7.17">people act in groups say when they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="116.43" dur="6.149">doing extreme things can we describe</text><text start="119.219" dur="5.601">that using the same kind of mathematics</text><text start="122.579" dur="6.481">and it turns out that we can</text><text start="124.82" dur="6.249">collectively people behave in quite</text><text start="129.06" dur="4.02">predictable ways and one of the things</text><text start="131.069" dur="4.801">that we&amp;#39;ve been particularly looking at</text><text start="133.08" dur="4.95">and in the last couple of years and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="135.87" dur="4.85">now becoming a very important topic is</text><text start="138.03" dur="5.55">how could people do that online online</text><text start="140.72" dur="5.62">people are freer they&amp;#39;re not kind of</text><text start="143.58" dur="4.56">bound by who they live next to or who</text><text start="146.34" dur="4.74">their immediate friends are in work</text><text start="148.14" dur="4.86">they&amp;#39;re free to explore and what you see</text><text start="151.08" dur="5.01">of a patent is very very definite</text><text start="153" dur="4.62">patterns appear in a way that you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="156.09" dur="3.66">actually see in the real world but they</text><text start="157.62" dur="4.44">happens in the online world and so the</text><text start="159.75" dur="4.08">online world where we do worry about</text><text start="162.06" dur="4.77">what people do collectively</text><text start="163.83" dur="5.49">we do worry about extreme groups that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="166.83" dur="4.32">where the mathematics can actually be</text><text start="169.32" dur="4.43">more powerful and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="171.15" dur="2.6">looking at</text></transcript>
