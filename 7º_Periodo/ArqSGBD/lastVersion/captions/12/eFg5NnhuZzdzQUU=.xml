nicely</text><text start="5.08" dur="3.599">which is why we end up with uneven</text><text start="6.399" dur="3.921">months of either 30 or 31 days except</text><text start="8.679" dur="3.641">for February the runt of the litter</text><text start="10.32" dur="5.359">which gets only 28 except when it gets</text><text start="12.32" dur="4.799">29 and then the year is 366 days long</text><text start="15.679" dur="2.801">why does that happen what kind of crazy</text><text start="17.119" dur="3">Universe do we live in where some years</text><text start="18.48" dur="3.719">are longer than others to answer this we</text><text start="20.119" dur="3.641">need to know just what is a year way</text><text start="22.199" dur="3.041">over simplifying it a year is the time</text><text start="23.76" dur="3.24">it takes the Earth to make one trip</text><text start="25.24" dur="3.64">around the Sun this happens to line up</text><text start="27" dur="3.199">with a cycle of the seasons now drawing</text><text start="28.88" dur="2.799">a little diagram like this show the</text><text start="30.199" dur="3.281">earth jauntily going around the Sun is</text><text start="31.679" dur="3.161">easy to do but accurately tracking a</text><text start="33.48" dur="2.72">year is tricky when you&amp;#39;re on Earth</text><text start="34.84" dur="3.239">because the universe doesn&amp;#39;t provide an</text><text start="36.2" dur="3.4">overhead map on Earth you only get to</text><text start="38.079" dur="2.8">see the seasons change and the obvious</text><text start="39.6" dur="2.84">way to keep track of their comings and</text><text start="40.879" dur="4.36">goings is to count the days passing</text><text start="42.44" dur="4.119">which gives you a 365-day calendar but</text><text start="45.239" dur="3.081">as soon as you start to use that</text><text start="46.559" dur="3.601">calendar it slowly gets out of sync with</text><text start="48.32" dur="3.399">the seasons and with each passing year</text><text start="50.16" dur="3.16">the Gap gets bigger and bigger and</text><text start="51.719" dur="3.081">bigger in three decades the calendar</text><text start="53.32" dur="2.719">will be off by a week and in a few</text><text start="54.8" dur="2.72">hundred years the seasons would be</text><text start="56.039" dur="3.121">flipped meaning Christmas celebrations</text><text start="57.52" dur="3.559">taking place in summer which would be</text><text start="59.16" dur="3.44">crazy why does this happen did we count</text><text start="61.079" dur="2.721">the days wrong well the calendar</text><text start="62.6" dur="2.96">predicts that the time it takes for the</text><text start="63.8" dur="4.319">earth to go around the Sun is</text><text start="65.56" dur="4.199">8,760 hours but if you actually timed it</text><text start="68.119" dur="2.961">with a stopwatch you&amp;#39;d see that a year</text><text start="69.759" dur="3.241">is really longer than the calendar</text><text start="71.08" dur="3.52">predicts by almost 6 hours so our</text><text start="73" dur="3.799">calendar is moving ever so slightly</text><text start="74.6" dur="3.6">faster than the seasons actually change</text><text start="76.799" dur="3.161">and thus we come to the fundamental</text><text start="78.2" dur="3.84">problem of all calendars the day night</text><text start="79.96" dur="4.08">cycle while easy to count has nothing to</text><text start="82.04" dur="3.64">do with the yearly cycle day and night</text><text start="84.04" dur="3.16">are caused by Earth rotating about its</text><text start="85.68" dur="3.079">axis when you&amp;#39;re on the side facing the</text><text start="87.2" dur="3.36">sun it&amp;#39;s daytime and when you&amp;#39;re on the</text><text start="88.759" dur="3.081">other side it&amp;#39;s night but this rotation</text><text start="90.56" dur="2.76">is no more connected to the orbital</text><text start="91.84" dur="2.72">motion around the Sun than a ballerina</text><text start="93.32" dur="2.96">spinning on the back of a truck is</text><text start="94.56" dur="3.08">connected to the truck&amp;#39;s cruising speed</text><text start="96.28" dur="2.64">counting the number of ballerina turns</text><text start="97.64" dur="2.759">to predict how long the truck takes to</text><text start="98.92" dur="3.36">drive in a circle might give you a rough</text><text start="100.399" dur="3.641">idea but it&amp;#39;s crazy to expect it to be</text><text start="102.28" dur="3.6">precise counting the days to track the</text><text start="104.04" dur="3.119">orbit is pretty much the same thing and</text><text start="105.88" dur="3.44">so it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a surprise when the</text><text start="107.159" dur="4.161">earth doesn&amp;#39;t happen to make 365</text><text start="109.32" dur="5.399">complete spins in a year irritatingly</text><text start="111.32" dur="5.079">while 365 days are too few 366 days are</text><text start="114.719" dur="3.44">too many and still cause the seasons to</text><text start="116.399" dur="3.4">drift out of sink just in the opposite</text><text start="118.159" dur="3.28">way the solution to all this is the</text><text start="119.799" dur="3.881">sleep year where February gets an extra</text><text start="121.439" dur="3.841">day but only every 4 years this works</text><text start="123.68" dur="3.359">pretty well as each year the calendar is</text><text start="125.28" dur="3.28">about a quarter Day short so after 4</text><text start="127.039" dur="3.481">years you add an extra day to get back</text><text start="128.56" dur="4.2">in alignment huzzah the problem has been</text><text start="130.52" dur="3.92">solved except it hasn&amp;#39;t lengthening the</text><text start="132.76" dur="3.199">calendar by 1 day every 4 years is</text><text start="134.44" dur="3.24">slightly too much and the calendar still</text><text start="135.959" dur="3.681">falls behind the seasons at a rate of 1</text><text start="137.68" dur="3.88">day per 100 years which is fine for the</text><text start="139.64" dur="3.84">apathetic but not for calendar designers</text><text start="141.56" dur="3.8">who want everything to line up perfectly</text><text start="143.48" dur="4.2">to fix the irregularity every Century</text><text start="145.36" dur="5.04">the leap year is skipped so 1896 and</text><text start="147.68" dur="3.96">1904 were leap years but 1900 wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="150.4" dur="3.32">this is better but still leaves the</text><text start="151.64" dur="4.44">calendar ever so slightly too fast with</text><text start="153.72" dur="3.799">an error of 1 day and 400 years so an</text><text start="156.08" dur="2.96">additional Clause is added to the skip</text><text start="157.519" dur="3.8">the century rule that if the century is</text><text start="159.04" dur="4.8">divisible by 400 then it will be a leap</text><text start="161.319" dur="4.601">year so 1900 and 21100 aren&amp;#39;t leap years</text><text start="163.84" dur="3.96">but 2,000 is with these three rules the</text><text start="165.92" dur="3.92">error is now just one day off in almost</text><text start="167.8" dur="3.48">8,000 years which the current calendar</text><text start="169.84" dur="3.24">declares mission accomplished and so</text><text start="171.28" dur="3.48">calls it a day which is probably quite</text><text start="173.08" dur="2.879">reasonable because 8,000 years ago</text><text start="174.76" dur="3.08">humans were just figuring out that</text><text start="175.959" dur="3.28">farming might be a good idea and 8,000</text><text start="177.84" dur="3">years from now we&amp;#39;ll hopefully be using</text><text start="179.239" dur="2.72">a calendar with a better date tracking</text><text start="180.84" dur="2.84">system but perhaps you&amp;#39;re a</text><text
