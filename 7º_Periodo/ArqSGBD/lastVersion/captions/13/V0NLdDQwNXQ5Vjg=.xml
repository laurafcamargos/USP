dur="3.08">watching this video have probably seen</text><text start="197.599" dur="3.481">the basics of a demo like this before</text><text start="199.28" dur="3.239">but humor me because it&amp;#39;s really fun to</text><text start="201.08" dur="3.799">play with so I&amp;#39;m feeding that magnet</text><text start="202.519" dur="4.561">over there a sine wave from this signal</text><text

one of these</text><text start="325.6" dur="4.719">patterns form in really slow motion</text><text start="328.479" dur="4.081">here&amp;#39;s a clip similar to the intro again</text><text

travels</text><text start="342.6" dur="3.68">back at the same speed at this end</text><text start="344.639" dur="3.521">because we&amp;#39;ve got a lot more weight on</text><text start="346.28" dur="3.96">the string the reflection is a little</text><text start="348.16" dur="3.879">funkier but the wave still reflects and</text><text start="350.24" dur="3.56">starts its second trip down the

dur="4.879">next the wave is still there it&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="358.479" dur="3.84">getting very small so what happens</text><text start="360.479" dur="3.84">different when we get the

dur="4.879">we actuate the coil to pump in another</text><text start="368.68" dur="5.239">wave we see that the wave appears to</text><text start="371.319" dur="4.44">reflect back Amplified there are a few</text><text start="373.919" dur="3.601">ways to think about this if you wanted</text><text start="375.759" dur="3.601">to you could calculate the force this</text><text start="377.52" dur="3.32">magnet assembly is exerting on a string</text><text start="379.36" dur="3.2">that&amp;#39;s already deformed and see how the</text><text start="380.84" dur="2.84">second actuation changes the curve of</text><text start="382.56" dur="3.12">the Rope but that would be pretty</text><text start="383.68" dur="3.56">complicated I think most physicists</text><text start="385.68" dur="3.2">would just say that you&amp;#39;re adding a</text><text start="387.24" dur="3.32">second wave to the string and then</text><text start="388.88" dur="3.2">they&amp;#39;re in a super position I do need to</text><text start="390.56" dur="3.16">say that using the word superp position</text><text start="392.08" dur="3.04">on YouTube is going to make people think</text><text start="393.72" dur="3.08">of quantum in the comments it has</text><text start="395.12" dur="2.799">nothing to do with Quantum super</text><text start="396.8" dur="2.88">position just means you&amp;#39;re adding

dur="3.56">waves together and we&amp;#39;re going to get to</text><text start="402.919" dur="4">that limit in a little while but for</text><text start="404.72" dur="4.12">right now it totally works now there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="406.919" dur="4.4">nothing stopping us from adding as many</text><text start="408.84" dur="4.16">waves as we want to this string so</text><text start="411.319" dur="3.361">before we get to the waves on top of</text><text start="413" dur="4">each other I&amp;#39;m going to add another</text><text start="414.68" dur="4.28">totally separate wave to this system if</text><text start="417" dur="4.44">I double the frequency of the pulses</text><text start="418.96" dur="5.2">we&amp;#39;ll get two separate waves on the</text><text start="421.44" dur="4.28">string

wave reaches the far</text><text start="466.759" dur="4.201">end I launch in a second wave and then</text><text start="469.039" dur="3.56">the third pulse of the magnet catches</text><text

holds on</text><text start="526.04" dur="5.08">to some kinetic energy if we press play</text><text start="528.839" dur="5.241">we see this bit continues to go up and</text><text start="531.12" dur="5.279">this bit continues to go down and this</text><text start="534.08" dur="4.12">sort of recreates the waves that were</text><text start="536.399" dur="3.041">hidden they both keep moving and it</text><text start="538.2" dur="3.52">looks like they just pass through each</text><text start="539.44" dur="4.16">each other if you want I think it also</text><text start="541.72" dur="4.28">helps to imagine one of these waves</text><text start="543.6" dur="4.919">Frozen now having a wave travel through</text><text start="546" dur="4.76">a rope that&amp;#39;s already bent is not</text><text

if they</text><text start="596.6" dur="5.2">were both at the same spot and traveling</text><text start="599.44" dur="5.32">in the same direction the visible wave</text><text start="601.8" dur="4.96">would be taller all the time okay so</text><text start="604.76" dur="4.519">finally here&amp;#39;s the clip from the intro</text><text start="606.76" dur="5.639">again our first wave leaves the driver</text><text start="609.279" dur="5.921">bounces returns bounces again and then</text><text start="612.399" dur="5.12">the magnet fires to make another wave</text><text start="615.2" dur="4.319">now I&amp;#39;m overlaying the original wave and</text><text start="617.519" dur="4.32">the wave after amplification and you can</text><text start="619.519" dur="4.32">see they don&amp;#39;t line up the wave the</text><text start="621.839" dur="4.401">second time around is just a little bit</text><text start="623.839" dur="4.44">taller and this slow build is the</text><text start="626.24" dur="4.039">beginnings of resonance if you imagine</text><text start="628.279" dur="4.161">this as the sum of two waves we have the</text><text start="630.279" dur="4.281">original wave that was created bounced</text><text start="632.44" dur="4.04">back bounced back again and was a lot</text><text start="634.56" dur="4.48">smaller than when it started and then we</text><text

wave and when that</text><text start="643.72" dur="4.2">combination wave gets back to the magnet</text><text start="646" dur="4.56">we can start a third wave and then the</text><text start="647.92" dur="4.76">result is even taller it&amp;#39;s the brand new</text><text start="650.56" dur="4.079">third wave plus whatever&amp;#39;s left over</text><text start="652.68" dur="3.88">from the first and second waves if we</text><text start="654.639" dur="3.44">keep doing this of course there are</text><text start="656.56" dur="3.6">diminishing returns because all these</text><text start="658.079" dur="4.401">leftover waves are getting ever smaller</text><text start="660.16" dur="5.72">but they&amp;#39;re still there so with each</text><text start="662.48" dur="6.44">cycle our net wave height

dur="4.599">frequency in this case I&amp;#39;m firing the</text><text start="672.959" dur="6.12">magnet at 4 Hertz when the string wants</text><text start="675.399" dur="6.201">to resonate at 3.85 HZ it&amp;#39;s just a tiny</text><text start="679.079" dur="4.281">bit faster but it makes a difference so</text><text start="681.6" dur="4.72">we end up launching a wave down the</text><text start="683.36" dur="5.4">string slightly before the first wave is</text><text start="686.32" dur="5">reflected and instead of adding together</text><text start="688.76" dur="4.4">your two waves just sort of smear out</text><text start="691.32" dur="3.519">and then we had a third wave so now we</text><text start="693.16" dur="3.2">have three waves that don&amp;#39;t line up and</text><text

start="843.92" dur="4.64">situation like this the first question</text><text start="846.04" dur="4.799">should be where&amp;#39;s the energy every time</text><text start="848.56" dur="4.12">we shake the coil over here we add</text><text start="850.839" dur="4.401">roughly the same amount of energy to the</text><text start="852.68" dur="5.399">string and that energy is dissipated as</text><text

every</text><text start="878.8" dur="4.8">single time we have to add a wave to the</text><text start="880.839" dur="5.081">signal the amplitude should go up we</text><text start="883.6"

start="908.48" dur="3.24">but this of course applies to the</text><text start="910.04" dur="3.4">traveling wave as well because standing</text><text start="911.72" dur="3.96">waves are just made of

dur="4.68">measure the height of the wave we see</text><text start="919.759" dur="5.561">it&amp;#39;s decaying to be extremely specific</text><text start="922.48" dur="4.88">the rate of Decay is

start="930.12" dur="4.32">the end when the wave is short it looks</text><text start="932.48" dur="4.12">like it&amp;#39;s shrinking more slowly but if</text><text start="934.44" dur="4">we take that

start="941.079" dur="4.601">very particular situation is called</text><text start="943.24" dur="4.64">exponential decay let&amp;#39;s say this is the</text><text start="945.68" dur="4.56">height of the wave every time it comes</text><text start="947.88" dur="4.439">back if we keep pumping the system we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="950.24" dur="4.079">basically just adding all of these

more</text><text start="976.759" dur="4.041">energy than that during its round trip</text><text start="979.279" dur="3.761">so that when it made it back to the</text><text start="980.8"

dur="4.08">tracing this one tiny piece of string as</text><text start="1231.08" dur="4.16">it moves in a loop have to do with our</text><text start="1233.32" dur="3.44">physics equations breaking well

that&amp;#39;s not what the normal math</text><text start="1241.6" dur="5.199">wave equation has us do in general we</text><text start="1244.44" dur="4.28">say ah the side to side components are</text><text start="1246.799" dur="3.721">basically the same so let&amp;#39;s say the</text><text start="1248.72" dur="4.48">force on this little bit of string is</text><text start="1250.52" dur="5.159">only up and down assuming that each</text><text start="1253.2" dur="5.479">point moves up and down exclusively</text><text start="1255.679" dur="5.041">makes the equations a lot simpler this</text><text start="1258.679" dur="4.801">simplification means that we can easily</text><text start="1260.72" dur="4.64">superimpose waves or add them together</text><text start="1263.48" dur="4.16">because if we only consider points to be</text><text start="1265.36" dur="5.199">moving up and down we can just line them</text><text start="1267.64" dur="6.12">up and sum the amplitudes this adding of</text><text start="1270.559" dur="5.441">waves is why resonance works but in</text><text start="1273.76" dur="4.039">reality the ropes stretch and shift a</text><text start="1276" dur="4.36">little bit and that means we can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1277.799" dur="4.76">simply add up the waves the up and down</text><text start="1280.36" dur="4.04">approximation holds for relatively small</text><text start="1282.559" dur="4.081">waves but if you try to get to something</text><text start="1284.4" dur="4.399">huge it gets messy in a hurry to look at</text><text start="1286.64" dur="4.039">a concrete example let&amp;#39;s change the</text><text start="1288.799" dur="3.401">resonant frequency of this string by</text><text start="1290.679" dur="3.561">putting a wave through it if we do</text><text start="1292.2" dur="4.04">something fun here we can play two waves</text><text start="1294.24" dur="4.039">into the string at once I was able to</text><text

both</text><text start="1307.32" dur="3.959">waves now this gets a little weird</text><text start="1309.24" dur="3.919">because in the real world it&amp;#39;s very hard</text><text start="1311.279" dur="3.76">to produce the exact story that I was</text><text start="1313.159" dur="4.041">expecting when I wrote this script the</text><text start="1315.039" dur="4.64">tricky part is that the frequency needed</text><text start="1317.2" dur="4.24">to generate these waves changes with the</text><text start="1319.679" dur="3.6">amplitude of the wave and the fact that</text><text start="1321.44" dur="3.96">we&amp;#39;re playing two of them at once now</text><text start="1323.279" dur="3.841">this is very difficult to quantify</text><text start="1325.4" dur="5.12">because the

start="1332.84" dur="3.88">the biggest sources of weirdness in my</text><text start="1334.88" dur="4.2">experiment was probably how the string</text><text start="1336.72" dur="4.36">coupled to the

start="1342.88" dur="4.32">the long wave at 7.41 Herz and the short</text><text start="1346.159" dur="2.921">wave at</text><text start="1347.2" dur="4.64">3813 Herz</text><text start="1349.08" dur="4.68">even those don&amp;#39;t line up exactly because</text><text start="1351.84" dur="3.959">we would expect the second wave to be</text><text start="1353.76" dur="4.76">five times the frequency of the first</text><text start="1355.799" dur="4.401">but when I play both waves at once with</text><text start="1358.52" dur="3.08">the added restriction that they have to</text><text start="1360.2" dur="3.32">be multiples of each other for the</text><text start="1361.6" dur="4.439">signal generator to work I got a</text><text start="1363.52" dur="5.48">significantly higher frequency for both</text><text start="1366.039" dur="5.081">waves so somehow we get a resonance at</text><text start="1369" dur="3.679">one frequency and then again under</text><text start="1371.12" dur="3.4">slightly different conditions we get</text><text start="1372.679" dur="4.081">what looks like the same resonance the</text><text start="1374.52" dur="4.84">string is moving in the same way but at</text><text start="1376.76" dur="4.84">a different frequency so imagine we play</text><text start="1379.36" dur="4.28">a signal into a plain string and then</text><text start="1381.6" dur="4.12">imagine the same signal playing into a</text><text start="1383.64" dur="5.039">string that already has the other wave</text><text start="1385.72" dur="5.079">in it the second string is longer of</text><text start="1388.679" dur="3.921">course in the no sideways movement</text><text start="1390.799" dur="2.961">approximation this doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text><text start="1392.6" dur="3.319">because you can just add them up</text><text start="1393.76" dur="4.399">vertically but in the real world the</text><text start="1395.919" dur="3.76">second string is longer now the effect</text><text start="1398.159" dur="3.681">here might be hard to predict when you</text><text start="1399.679" dur="4.281">make the string longer the wave has</text><text start="1401.84" dur="4.6">farther to travel before it reflects</text><text start="1403.96" dur="4.68">back which should slow down its trip and</text><text start="1406.44" dur="4.64">decrease its resonant frequency but</text><text start="1408.64" dur="4.88">we&amp;#39;ve also elongated the string by</text><text start="1411.08" dur="4.44">stretching it and increasing the tension</text><text start="1413.52" dur="4.56">in the string makes the waves travel</text><text start="1415.52" dur="5.12">faster increasing the frequency these</text><text start="1418.08" dur="4.88">two effects fight it out and in the end</text><text start="1420.64" dur="4.159">we&amp;#39;re left with a modified higher</text><text start="1422.96" dur="3.199">resonant frequency if you want to</text><text start="1424.799" dur="5.041">imagine this you can also just take one</text><text start="1426.159" dur="6.281">of these chords and say oh it has this</text><text start="1429.84" dur="5.24">frequency and then you pull it</text><text start="1432.44" dur="4.04">tight and it has a higher frequency so</text><text start="1435.08" dur="4">this is what&amp;#39;s happening it&amp;#39;s just that</text><text start="1436.48" dur="4.88">instead of pulling on it with your hands</text><text start="1439.08" dur="4.199">it&amp;#39;s deformed because there&amp;#39;s a wave</text><text start="1441.36" dur="3.919">going through

dur="7.96">least make the antinode here as wide as</text><text start="1483" dur="7.76">possible at 19.6 Hertz so it&amp;#39;s a little</text><text start="1488.08" dur="5.16">bit higher yet and there&amp;#39;s clearly a</text><text start="1490.76" dur="4.96">second wave on the line cuz the nodes</text><text start="1493.24" dur="4.76">are moving up and down I expected this</text><text

easily get a</text><text start="1502" dur="4.36">higher amplitude oscillation by slowly</text><text start="1504.48" dur="3.919">increasing the frequency and then</text><text start="1506.36" dur="3.84">eventually it falls off and it drops to</text><text start="1508.399" dur="4.441">zero the bottom line here is that</text><text start="1510.2" dur="4">physicists like things to be simple
