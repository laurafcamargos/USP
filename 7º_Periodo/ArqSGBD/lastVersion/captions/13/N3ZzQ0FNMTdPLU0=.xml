a</text><text start="4.24" dur="3.559">bunch of really interesting people there</text><text start="5.96" dur="3.84">were many talks and giant balloons and</text><text start="7.799" dur="3.92">much discussion of what the future of</text><text start="9.8" dur="3.919">Education might look like which is no</text><text start="11.719" dur="3.521">small issue because how Society raises</text><text start="13.719" dur="3.201">the next generation of scientists</text><text start="15.24" dur="3.76">doctors and programmers shapes the</text><text start="16.92" dur="3.84">future of human civilization it was an</text><text start="19" dur="3.4">amazing few days and if you&amp;#39;ll tolerate</text><text start="20.76" dur="3">my ramblings I&amp;#39;d like to share some of</text><text start="22.4" dur="3.44">my thoughts on this as someone who&amp;#39;s</text><text start="23.76" dur="4.04">worked as an educator both in and out of</text><text start="25.84" dur="3.759">schools this is how schools have pretty</text><text start="27.8" dur="3.36">much always looked a guy in the front</text><text start="29.599" dur="3.601">who knows all the things and students</text><text start="31.16" dur="3.68">who don&amp;#39;t so the guy tells them but a</text><text start="33.2" dur="4.039">teacher explains things at the right</text><text start="34.84" dur="4.52">pace for maybe one student in the room</text><text start="37.239" dur="3.64">during a lesson everyone else is either</text><text start="39.36" dur="3.44">bored because they already understand</text><text start="40.879" dur="3.561">the material or lost because they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="42.8" dur="3.68">missing knowledge they should already</text><text start="44.44" dur="3.84">have but at the end of the lesson</text><text start="46.48" dur="4.44">regardless of student understanding the</text><text start="48.28" dur="4.32">curriculum marches relentlessly on and</text><text start="50.92" dur="3.52">whether the teacher uses a Blackboard</text><text start="52.6" dur="4.24">whiteboard or Smartboard and whether the</text><text start="54.44" dur="4.68">students use tablets paper or tablets</text><text start="56.84" dur="3.92">again this system isn&amp;#39;t really any</text><text start="59.12" dur="4.439">different it&amp;#39;s just just technology</text><text start="60.76" dur="5">doing the same thing in a shinier way</text><text start="63.559" dur="3.88">but the internet is different and behind</text><text start="65.76" dur="3.64">the scenes something interesting is</text><text start="67.439" dur="4.241">happening that hints at the shape of</text><text start="69.4" dur="4.52">things to come in a perfect School each</text><text start="71.68" dur="4.64">student would have a personal tutor like</text><text start="73.92" dur="4.559">Aristotle to Alexander the Great but if</text><text start="76.32" dur="4">your education policy is Aristotle for</text><text start="78.479" dur="3.721">everyone then there are three big</text><text start="80.32" dur="3.56">problems with this first there aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="82.2" dur="4">enough humans on Earth to individually</text><text start="83.88" dur="4.44">tutor every child and even if there were</text><text start="86.2" dur="4.16">it would be horrifically expensive and</text><text start="88.32" dur="4.6">even if neither Manpower nor money was a</text><text start="90.36" dur="5.28">problem not everyone is as good a tutor</text><text start="92.92" dur="5.08">as Aristotle but technology is solving</text><text start="95.64" dur="4.119">these problems starting with number one</text><text start="98" dur="3.92">for who needs humans when the internet</text><text start="99.759" dur="4.4">can teach you all the things want to</text><text start="101.92" dur="4.28">learn calculus get started need an AP</text><text start="104.159" dur="3.96">biology course go watch this one along</text><text start="106.2" dur="3.879">with hundreds of thousands of other</text><text start="108.119" dur="3.841">students the internet massively</text><text start="110.079" dur="4.481">multiplies the audience of potential</text><text start="111.96" dur="4.199">teachers and solves the Manpower problem</text><text start="114.56" dur="3">but isn&amp;#39;t cheerleading the internet the</text><text start="116.159" dur="3.801">same thing I was complaining about</text><text start="117.56" dur="4.479">before new tech doing old things just</text><text start="119.96" dur="3.68">with more shiny after all if you were a</text><text start="122.039" dur="3.521">pre- internet child with bookish</text><text start="123.64" dur="3.839">inclinations there&amp;#39;s always been a place</text><text start="125.56" dur="3.679">to teach you all the things and people</text><text start="127.479" dur="3.361">thought that radio and TV were going to</text><text start="129.239" dur="4.121">revolutionize education by giving</text><text start="130.84" dur="4.96">teachers huge audiences but here we</text><text start="133.36" dur="4.56">still are these are good points but the</text><text start="135.8" dur="5.2">internet also solves the cost problem in</text><text start="137.92" dur="5.36">a way that radio and TV never could real</text><text start="141" dur="4.72">shows are expensive to make and even the</text><text start="143.28" dur="4.76">best of educational TV often gets pushed</text><text start="145.72" dur="4.36">aside for Dumber more popular stuff that</text><text start="148.04" dur="4.4">not coincidentally is also more</text><text start="150.08" dur="4.6">profitable this is known as the History</text><text start="152.44" dur="4.68">Channel effect but the cost to access</text><text start="154.68" dur="4.72">the internet is only going down as is</text><text start="157.12" dur="4.199">the cost to make stuff for the internet</text><text start="159.4" dur="3.839">which is why a guy with some paper and a</text><text start="161.319" dur="3.881">marker in his bedroom can pull in a</text><text start="163.239" dur="3.841">million views a month at essentially</text><text start="165.2" dur="4.44">zero cost and doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry</text><text start="167.08" dur="4.28">about competition from stuff like this</text><text start="169.64" dur="3.76">so the internet solves problems one and</text><text start="171.36" dur="3.959">two but educational videos still aren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="173.4" dur="4.36">personalized to students and that leaves</text><text start="175.319" dur="4.961">YouTube as a library of video not a</text><text start="177.76" dur="4.839">tutor like Aristotle but you can build</text><text start="180.28" dur="5.72">on top of YouTube and what I see coming</text><text start="182.599" dur="5.2">is this digital Aristotle for everyone a</text><text start="186" dur="3.68">computer program that tutors students</text><text start="187.799" dur="3.961">individually by pulling from a library</text><text start="189.68" dur="4.119">of videos like YouTube a program that</text><text start="191.76" dur="3.839">tests students on what they know and</text><text start="193.799" dur="3.601">more importantly adapts to the way they</text><text start="195.599" dur="3.441">learn over time by comparing the</text><text start="197.4" dur="3.52">effectiveness of different videos and</text><text start="199.04" dur="5.04">different tests to discover</text><text start="200.92" dur="4.76">scientifically what works best this</text><text start="204.08" dur="3.92">isn&amp;#39;t a fantasy there are people</text><text start="205.68" dur="4.44">building parts of this right now even if</text><text start="208" dur="4.319">digital Aristotle isn&amp;#39;t their EXP licit</text><text start="210.12" dur="4.479">goal and one of these places is the Con</text><text start="212.319" dur="6.041">Academy which is more than just Sal&amp;#39;s</text><text start="214.599" dur="7.041">soothing voice if this does not blow</text><text start="218.36" dur="5.4">your mind you have no emotion behind the</text><text start="221.64" dur="4.08">website is incredibly complicated</text><text start="223.76" dur="3.52">software testing everything about</text><text start="225.72" dur="3.28">student learning the effectiveness of</text><text start="227.28" dur="4.12">different videos different tests and</text><text start="229" dur="3.92">different ways of asking questions and</text><text start="231.4" dur="4.199">while it may seem primitive now</text><text start="232.92" dur="4.519">technology only gets better faster when</text><text start="235.599" dur="4.081">digital Aristotle arrives it will be</text><text start="237.439" dur="5.041">cheaper less labor intensive and better</text><text start="239.68" dur="4.6">better than human teachers ever could be</text><text start="242.48" dur="3.64">I often hear the argument that digital</text><text start="244.28" dur="3.599">Aristotle or something like it will free</text><text start="246.12" dur="3.479">teachers to float around the classroom</text><text start="247.879" dur="3.72">helping kids work on interesting</text><text start="249.599" dur="4.081">projects and while that might happen in</text><text start="251.599" dur="4.48">the near-term I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="253.68" dur="4.799">long-term reality for what happens when</text><text start="256.079" dur="4.84">digital Aristotle truly knows students</text><text start="258.479" dur="4.641">better than the teacher when for every</text><text start="260.919" dur="4.521">topic of human endeavor it&amp;#39;s able to</text><text start="263.12" dur="4.16">take the best and brightest kids further</text><text start="265.44" dur="4.479">down the path of knowledge than their</text><text start="267.28" dur="4.759">teachers ever could I doubt that schools</text><text start="269.919" dur="4.201">will go away after all they aren&amp;#39;t just</text><text start="272.039" dur="4.081">about learning but also freeing parents</text><text start="274.12" dur="3.68">to work in the economy while their feral</text><text start="276.12" dur="4.2">children are turned into civilized</text><text start="277.8" dur="4.28">adults but schools will be radically</text><text start="280.32" dur="4.719">different and there will be far fewer</text><text start="282.08" dur="4.559">teachers working in them doing far less</text><text start="285.039" dur="4.041">and while that&amp;#39;s not great news for</text><text start="286.639" dur="4.4">teachers it&amp;#39;s awesome news for students</text><text start="289.08" dur="4.08">and Society right now if you&amp;#39;re a</text><text start="291.039" dur="4.44">student doing poorly School moves on</text><text start="293.16" dur="4.72">without you and if you&amp;#39;re doing well</text><text start="295.479" dur="5.081">School holds you back in the future I</text><text start="297.88" dur="4.44">see every human using digital Aristotle</text><text start="300.56" dur="3.479">for their whole life a tutor</text><text start="302.32" dur="3.36">personalized to them teaching them</text><text start="304.039" dur="4.081">exactly what they need to learn when</text><text start="305.68" dur="3.92">they&amp;#39;re best ready for it and when that</text><text start="308.12" dur="5.359">comes we&amp;#39;ll have
