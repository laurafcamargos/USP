dur="4.48">home you need a Loc with a clear view of</text><text start="31.119" dur="4.841">Polaris where you can leave your camera</text><text start="33.36" dur="4.4">set up for a full 24 hours without it</text><text start="35.96" dur="5.4">being messed with you need a way to</text><text start="37.76" dur="5.44">power a camera for 24 hours because no</text><text start="41.36" dur="4.679">camera stock battery is going to be able</text><text start="43.2" dur="4.359">to run a camera for a full 24 hours uh</text><text start="46.039" dur="4.961">let alone longer than that to give you</text><text start="47.559" dur="5.561">some splice time and uh third you of</text><text start="51" dur="4.52">course need a camera and that camera</text><text start="53.12" dur="5.36">needs to be able to automatically take</text><text start="55.52" dur="5.679">pictures every couple minutes and needs</text><text start="58.48" dur="4.48">to be able to adjust to changing light</text><text start="61.199" dur="4.161">conditions because of course taking a</text><text start="62.96" dur="4.44">picture in the dark is not the same as</text><text start="65.36" dur="4.119">taking a picture at noon my first</text><text start="67.4" dur="4.28">attempt at a 24-hour time lapse was over</text><text start="69.479" dur="4.761">the summer in North Carolina and we live</text><text start="71.68" dur="4.68">in the absolute middle of nowhere so I</text><text start="74.24" dur="3.96">was very certain you can just go set up</text><text start="76.36" dur="3.759">a tripod outside and know that it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="78.2" dur="4.44">going to be messed with for 24 hours I</text><text start="80.119" dur="4.121">was also able to power the camera just</text><text start="82.64" dur="3.96">with an AC adapter and some extension</text><text start="84.24" dur="5.199">cords running from the observatory</text><text start="86.6" dur="5.96">unfortunately this time lapse did not go</text><text start="89.439" dur="6.241">very well because uh although the first</text><text start="92.56" dur="4.68">part of the night was good it uh the</text><text start="95.68" dur="3.36">camera got doed over in the morning and</text><text start="97.24" dur="4.919">there was all sorts of fog that ruined</text><text start="99.04" dur="5.119">like half of the early morning footage</text><text start="102.159" dur="3.881">and uh then the next night it was cloudy</text><text start="104.159" dur="3.401">so I was trying to SP cloudy footage</text><text start="106.04" dur="4.32">into not cloudy footage and it just</text><text start="107.56" dur="5.48">didn&amp;#39;t work so I have kept trying I</text><text start="110.36" dur="5.039">think that this is like my fifth attempt</text><text start="113.04" dur="5.16">maybe and I finally got something that I</text><text start="115.399" dur="4.801">really like out here in California the</text><text start="118.2" dur="4.04">uh I guess other four times that I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="120.2" dur="4.199">tried to do this time lapse I have just</text><text start="122.24" dur="4.919">set up the camera in the living room uh</text><text start="124.399" dur="5.121">pointed out the window to the North and</text><text start="127.159" dur="4.401">the good news about that is that it&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="129.52" dur="5.359">no Morning Dew can possibly get on the</text><text start="131.56" dur="5.759">camera to mess up the lens uh there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="134.879" dur="4.72">power right there uh literally just</text><text start="137.319" dur="4.56">plugged into the wall with an AC adapter</text><text start="139.599" dur="3.841">and there&amp;#39;s no pedestrian traffic in our</text><text start="141.879" dur="3.121">living in the corner of our living room</text><text start="143.44" dur="4.159">by the window so I didn&amp;#39;t need to worry</text><text start="145" dur="5.68">about the camera moving over the 24-hour</text><text start="147.599" dur="4.401">span the uh difficulty is that now</text><text start="150.68" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;re looking through a window so you</text><text start="152" dur="4.16">have to block all of the excess</text><text start="153.92" dur="3.959">Reflections that you get especially at</text><text start="156.16" dur="4.24">night when it&amp;#39;s dark outside and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="157.879" dur="4.601">light inside and you&amp;#39;re getting</text><text start="160.4" dur="4.52">reflected light off the window back into</text><text start="162.48" dur="6.32">the camera that can be a problem I ended</text><text start="164.92" dur="8.64">up building a shroud out of two towels</text><text start="168.8" dur="6.96">uh a T-shirt and uh the base layer was a</text><text start="173.56" dur="4.28">large piece of dark colored felt that I</text><text start="175.76" dur="4.32">had left over for making a wizard&amp;#39;s hat</text><text start="177.84" dur="5.959">this spring the camera that I used used</text><text start="180.08" dur="7.96">for this was this uh Sony Alpha a6000</text><text start="183.799" dur="7.44">with this 12 mm lens it uh is a full</text><text start="188.04" dur="5.24">manual lens even the uh aperture is on a</text><text start="191.239" dur="4.881">ring here and it goes all the way down</text><text start="193.28" dur="4.56">to F2 which is awesome for taking like</text><text start="196.12" dur="3.6">Milky Way pictures that are single</text><text start="197.84" dur="4.36">static pictures but if you&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="199.72" dur="4.079">set this camera up so that it can take</text><text start="202.2" dur="5">good pictures in the middle of the night</text><text start="203.799" dur="6">or in the middle of the day uh not</text><text start="207.2" dur="5.16">having electronic control of the app</text><text start="209.799" dur="4.241">picture is actually uh it makes that</text><text start="212.36" dur="3.72">quite a challenge because you want to</text><text start="214.04" dur="4.399">give the camera as much adjustability as</text><text start="216.08" dur="4.6">it can to be able to go from Nighttime</text><text start="218.439" dur="4.121">shots to daytime shots and vice versa</text><text start="220.68" dur="4.32">the daytime here in Santa Barbara is</text><text start="222.56" dur="3.959">about a million times brighter than the</text><text start="225" dur="3.36">nighttime here in Santa Barbara when</text><text start="226.519" dur="3.521">you&amp;#39;re looking out the window and for</text><text start="228.36" dur="5.4">those of you familiar with photography</text><text start="230.04" dur="6.16">that is 20 full Optical stops of of</text><text start="233.76" dur="4.24">light difference so if you&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="236.2" dur="4.039">set up a camera to take a good picture</text><text start="238" dur="6.72">out the window uh you will need to set</text><text start="240.239" dur="6.92">it up 20 stops faster at night than in</text><text start="244.72" dur="4.92">the middle of the day I had the camera</text><text start="247.159" dur="5.041">set up in aperture priority mode for</text><text start="249.64" dur="4.439">this time lapse which means that every</text><text start="252.2" dur="3.28">time that it was about to take a picture</text><text start="254.079" dur="3.241">it looked at the picture that it was</text><text start="255.48" dur="4.96">about to take and said how much light is</text><text start="257.32" dur="4.759">there in this image and figured out how</text><text start="260.44" dur="4.64">long it wanted to hold the shutter open</text><text start="262.079" dur="5.001">and it got to pick that value so the</text><text start="265.08" dur="4.64">fastest that it can activate the shutter</text><text start="267.08" dur="4.28">is/ 14,000 of a second that&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="269.72" dur="3.56">really darn fast you don&amp;#39;t bring in a</text><text start="271.36" dur="4.92">whole lot of light in 4,000th of a</text><text start="273.28" dur="5.56">second now the slowest that it will</text><text start="276.28" dur="6">automatically set the shutter to go is</text><text start="278.84" dur="6">30 seconds so 1/ 14,000 of a second to</text><text start="282.28" dur="5.759">1/30th of a second is a huge difference</text><text start="284.84" dur="5.48">in how much light comes in it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="288.039" dur="4.081">120,000 times difference or something</text><text start="290.32" dur="4.8">like that but that&amp;#39;s still not enough</text><text start="292.12" dur="5.68">that&amp;#39;s only 17 Optical stops so you</text><text start="295.12" dur="5.04">still need more variability than the</text><text start="297.8" dur="4.04">shutter alone will give you I have done</text><text start="300.16" dur="4.2">this with electronic lenses the first</text><text start="301.84" dur="4.68">time I tried this with uh in North</text><text start="304.36" dur="5.16">Carolina I was using an electronic lens</text><text start="306.52" dur="5.44">that allowed for the camera to control</text><text start="309.52" dur="4.399">the aperture so you could just literally</text><text start="311.96" dur="4.84">make the whole all the light was coming</text><text start="313.919" dur="4.441">through bigger or smaller and uh that</text><text start="316.8" dur="4.519">would give you your extra light</text><text start="318.36" dur="5.92">variability unfortunately with this lens</text><text start="321.319" dur="5.481">because it&amp;#39;s a manual lens I do not have</text><text start="324.28" dur="5.759">electronic aperture control just manual</text><text start="326.8" dur="6.56">aperture control uh by turning the dial</text><text start="330.039" dur="5.121">so I was unable to use the Aperture to</text><text start="333.36" dur="3.92">give me those extra three stops of light</text><text start="335.16" dur="5.64">variability that I need uh cuz the</text><text start="337.28" dur="7.08">camera can&amp;#39;t turn this crank so I had to</text><text start="340.8" dur="6.519">resort to using an automatic ISO which I</text><text start="344.36" dur="5.6">I&amp;#39;m normally would not be a fan of it</text><text start="347.319" dur="4.121">basically the iso is like an artificial</text><text start="349.96" dur="3.079">enhancement of the light that&amp;#39;s there</text><text start="351.44" dur="5.879">it&amp;#39;s an electronic thing it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="353.039" dur="6.201">similar to taking a dark image in uh</text><text start="357.319" dur="3.88">image editing program on the computer</text><text start="359.24" dur="4.799">and just artificially brightening the</text><text start="361.199" dur="5.84">whole thing uh so it&amp;#39;s not great but it</text><text start="364.039" dur="4.521">is uh something that the camera can do</text><text start="367.039" dur="4.201">by itself in order to take these</text><text start="368.56" dur="4.84">pictures which is what I needed so I</text><text start="371.24" dur="5.12">ended up setting up an auto ISO to go</text><text start="373.4" dur="4.799">between uh 100 and 800 which the</text><text start="376.36" dur="3.6">difference in that is 2 to the 3 so that</text><text start="378.199" dur="5.72">gives me my extra three stops that I</text><text start="379.96" dur="5.72">needed and that means that if you add</text><text start="383.919" dur="4.68">the three stops of variability of the</text><text start="385.68" dur="6.2">iso to the 17 stops of variability of</text><text start="388.599" dur="5.16">the shutter speed I get my full 20 stops</text><text start="391.88" dur="3.759">of variants that let me take nighttime</text><text start="393.759" dur="3.801">pictures or daytime pictures in the</text><text start="395.639" dur="3.881">middle of the night the camera is</text><text start="397.56" dur="4.72">shooting at an ISO of 800 and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="399.52" dur="4.92">holding the shutter open for 30 seconds</text><text start="402.28" dur="5.319">and in the middle of the day the camera</text><text start="404.44" dur="4.72">is shooting at an ISO of 100 and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="407.599" dur="4.32">only holding the shutter open for a</text><text start="409.16" dur="4.759">4,000th of a second so it&amp;#39;s capturing so</text><text start="411.919" dur="4.081">much less light in the middle of the day</text><text start="413.919" dur="3.72">than in the middle of the night but</text><text start="416" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s necessary in order to take</text><text start="417.639" dur="6.041">a time lapse that spans</text><text start="420.56" dur="6.199">days so I had the camera mounted on this</text><text start="423.68" dur="6.6">tripod sideways pointed up at about a</text><text start="426.759" dur="4.921">30° angle uh which here in Santa Barbara</text><text start="430.28" dur="3.8">is how high you&amp;#39;ve got a point to hit</text><text start="431.68" dur="4.04">Polaris and pointed exactly North so</text><text start="434.08" dur="5.28">that Polaris was in the center of the</text><text start="435.72" dur="5.879">camera frame and uh with the whole</text><text start="439.36" dur="4.399">shroud behind it the camera was ready to</text><text start="441.599" dur="4.761">physically be able to take pictures you</text><text start="443.759" dur="5.12">can go online and buy an intervalometer</text><text start="446.36" dur="4.239">for a camera which is basically a box</text><text start="448.879" dur="3.16">with a wire that plugs into the side of</text><text start="450.599" dur="4.16">the camera and it will activate the</text><text start="452.039" dur="5.481">shutter at a specified interval in order</text><text start="454.759" dur="4.521">to take uh time lapses so you&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="457.52" dur="3.399">basically taking picture after picture</text><text start="459.28" dur="4.24">the computer is pressing the button on</text><text start="460.919" dur="4.56">the top of the camera for you that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="463.52" dur="4.28">great but you know it&amp;#39;s a lot more fun</text><text start="465.479" dur="4.4">to try to build one yourself so this is</text><text start="467.8" dur="4.359">an external uh shutter release where you</text><text start="469.879" dur="3.681">can hold it down or press it in to hold</text><text start="472.159" dur="3.32">down the shutter for a long time or</text><text start="473.56" dur="3.479">something like that this is I think this</text><text start="475.479" dur="3.201">was the cheapest thing that I could</text><text start="477.039" dur="4.321">order on Amazon that would do this and</text><text start="478.68" dur="6.079">plug into this C camera and uh so it</text><text start="481.36" dur="6.239">plugs in with this multi-usb port it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="484.759" dur="4.201">really weird Port but I modified this</text><text start="487.599" dur="3.04">you will notice this does not look like</text><text start="488.96" dur="4.799">the picture from Amazon because it has</text><text start="490.639" dur="6.041">this extra little plug off to the side</text><text start="493.759" dur="6.681">and that extra little plug attaches to</text><text start="496.68" dur="6.16">this Arduino and um optic coupler</text><text start="500.44" dur="5.759">circuit that plugs</text><text start="502.84" dur="5.72">in just like that and when you power</text><text start="506.199" dur="4.801">this Arduino you can make the Arduino</text><text start="508.56" dur="4.32">send pulses to the after coupler and the</text><text start="511" dur="3.64">after coupler completes the circuit that</text><text start="512.88" dur="5.32">would normally be completed by pressing</text><text start="514.64" dur="6.24">this button so the Arduino is the timer</text><text start="518.2" dur="5.8">that actually activated this camera</text><text start="520.88" dur="5.76">every 2 minutes for a whole day once you</text><text start="524" dur="5.279">get everything set up and the camera</text><text start="526.64" dur="6.319">shroud is set and the timing is set and</text><text start="529.279" dur="6.881">the uh camera is aimed properly and all</text><text start="532.959" dur="5.12">of the uh camera settings are right then</text><text start="536.16" dur="4.08">you get to walk away for like a day and</text><text start="538.079" dur="4.121">a half and let it take pictures and then</text><text start="540.24" dur="5">come back and pull out an SD card with</text><text start="542.2" dur="4.68">like 20 or 30 gigb worth of garbage for</text><text start="545.24" dur="4.68">your computer to try to turn through in</text><text start="546.88" dur="5.28">Lightroom later I actually for this</text><text start="549.92" dur="5.2">fifth attempt actually took two full</text><text start="552.16" dur="5.08">days of footage and sliced the best day</text><text start="555.12" dur="4.44">out of that where I would have the best</text><text start="557.24" dur="4.48">opportunity to SPL the end of the day</text><text start="559.56" dur="4.64">into the beginning of the day and make</text><text start="561.72" dur="4.84">it look like it was one cohesive unit</text><text start="564.2" dur="5.36">and I had a lot of data that I brought</text><text start="566.56" dur="4.68">off the camera I actually took that seg</text><text start="569.56" dur="4.92">that I want once I picked my segment the</text><text start="571.24" dur="5.52">one day segment um I ended up rendering</text><text start="574.48" dur="6.799">about a day and a half&amp;#39;s worth of</text><text start="576.76" dur="6.319">pictures through Lightroom twice once uh</text><text start="581.279" dur="4.56">optimized so that you could see the</text><text start="583.079" dur="6.281">stars really well and optimized for</text><text start="585.839" dur="5.841">nighttime pictures and then another</text><text start="589.36" dur="6.44">another full set of renderings through</text><text start="591.68" dur="6.159">Lightroom for optimizing in the day so</text><text start="595.8" dur="3.8">that took a long time running all of the</text><text start="597.839" dur="2.721">nighttime pictures I think literally</text><text start="599.6" dur="3.6">took</text><text start="600.56" dur="4.36">like maybe seven or eight hours through</text><text start="603.2" dur="4.04">through Lightroom on my ThinkPad my</text><text start="604.92" dur="5.64">ThinkPad really hates me through</text><text start="607.24" dur="6.32">combination of Lightroom and mat lab I I</text><text start="610.56" dur="4.64">abuse my computer greatly but once you</text><text start="613.56" dur="3.959">have a time lapse optimized for</text><text start="615.2" dur="4.199">nighttime and a time lapse optimized for</text><text start="617.519" dur="3.721">daytime you can take those into your</text><text start="619.399" dur="3.961">favorite video editor and just splice</text><text start="621.24" dur="4.2">them so that it fades from the nighttime</text><text start="623.36" dur="5.44">optimize to daytime optimize nighttime</text><text start="625.44" dur="6.04">optimize and go back and forth and that</text><text start="628.8" dur="5.2">will give you you one time lapse that</text><text start="631.48" dur="6.159">looks good at night and good in the day</text><text start="634" dur="5.92">and uh it is one continuous segment once</text><text start="637.639" dur="5.44">you have your single cohesive video that</text><text start="639.92" dur="7.599">is a day and night optimized time lapse</text><text start="643.079" dur="6.161">for over 24 hours you basically find one</text><text start="647.519" dur="3.281">spot it&amp;#39;s easiest to do this at night</text><text start="649.24" dur="5.12">because there&amp;#39;s stars and you can align</text><text start="650.8" dur="6.08">it exactly but you find a time of day in</text><text start="654.36" dur="4.08">one at at the end of the clip and you</text><text start="656.88" dur="5.44">copy the clip and you move it and you</text><text start="658.44" dur="6.36">find that same time of day or same time</text><text start="662.32" dur="4.8">of day relative to the Stars at the</text><text start="664.8" dur="4.32">beginning of the clip so that you align</text><text start="667.12" dur="4.6">the end of the clip to the beginning of</text><text start="669.12" dur="5.839">itself and then you can trim it so that</text><text start="671.72" dur="7">it&amp;#39;s exactly 24 hours long and then you</text><text start="674.959" dur="5.641">can fade the clip into its own beginning</text><text start="678.72" dur="4.16">so that you&amp;#39;re left with something that</text><text start="680.6" dur="5.96">looks continuous because if you do a a</text><text start="682.88" dur="5.44">slow fade uh of one picture into another</text><text start="686.56" dur="4.519">picture that should look almost nearly</text><text start="688.32" dur="5.079">identical uh it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text><text start="691.079" dur="4.241">notice the splice in my time lapse the</text><text start="693.399" dur="4.521">only continuity error that I was able to</text><text start="695.32" dur="5.12">see was the fact that the window on the</text><text start="697.92" dur="5.88">side of the building uh moved ever so</text><text start="700.44" dur="5.199">slightly and at dusk you can see that</text><text start="703.8" dur="4.64">that&amp;#39;s where I chose to splice the</text><text start="705.639" dur="4.681">footage and the window moves not</text><text start="708.44" dur="4.36">immediately as if it were in time lapse</text><text start="710.32" dur="5.28">but it moves by fading out of this place</text><text start="712.8" dur="4.719">and fading into another place so it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="715.6" dur="3.72">slight error but considering that</text><text start="717.519" dur="3.681">everything else came out really well I</text><text start="719.32" dur="5.079">stuck with it at this point you</text><text start="721.2" dur="5.36">basically have a loopable gif it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="724.399" dur="4.68">a time lapse it lasts for 24 hours and</text><text start="726.56" dur="4.32">if you&amp;#39;ve done the sping really well it</text><text start="729.079" dur="3.281">just looks like it&amp;#39;s day after day after</text><text start="730.88" dur="2.92">day but if you are really paying</text><text start="732.36" dur="3.279">attention you can see that the exact</text><text start="733.8" dur="3.56">same things happen every day so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="735.639" dur="6.56">only one day of time lapse but it&amp;#39;s been</text><text start="737.36" dur="6.56">looped and the uh video could just be</text><text start="742.199" dur="4.32">left that way if you want to see it that</text><text start="743.92" dur="4.64">way but what I wanted to do was to do</text><text start="746.519" dur="6.161">the freeze the stars and make the Earth</text><text start="748.56" dur="7.959">move around them and I did that by just</text><text start="752.68" dur="5.959">taking my final uh complete time lapse</text><text start="756.519" dur="4">and the exact middle of my frame was</text><text start="758.639" dur="4.921">Polaris which meant that I could just</text><text start="760.519" dur="5.32">take the video uh key frame it at the</text><text start="763.56" dur="5.68">beginning vertically and then key frame</text><text start="765.839" dur="4.44">it at the end of the video uh vertically</text><text start="769.24" dur="3.839">plus</text><text start="770.279" dur="5.041">360° so that through the length of the</text><text start="773.079" dur="5.32">entire video it will flip itself all the</text><text start="775.32" dur="5.12">way over exactly once and that&amp;#39;s all you</text><text start="778.399" dur="6.081">need to do you&amp;#39;ve got a 24-hour time</text><text start="780.44" dur="6.12">lapse or a 23h hour and 56 minute time</text><text start="784.48" dur="4.44">lapse like this one</text><text start="786.56" dur="4.839">then you just have to make it rotate</text><text start="788.92" dur="4.479">once and any reasonable video editing</text><text start="791.399" dur="5.921">software should be able to do that I</text><text start="793.399" dur="5.601">also added a uh round black mask so it</text><text start="797.32" dur="3.6">would round off the top and bottom edge</text><text start="799" dur="4.16">of my image so that it would look like</text><text start="800.92" dur="4.479">it was sort of rotating within a circle</text><text start="803.16" dur="4.679">someday I want to do this with either a</text><text start="805.399" dur="4.24">fisheye lens or looking up at like the</text><text start="807.839" dur="5.8">side of a mountain or something so that</text><text start="809.639" dur="6.32">I can uh just get one circular frame for</text><text start="813.639" dur="4.521">the entire image and make the circular</text><text start="815.959" dur="3.841">frame move in a circle and that would</text><text start="818.16" dur="3.88">look a lot better than having these bars</text><text start="819.8" dur="4.8">on the side but for right now that&amp;#39;s all</text><text start="822.04" dur="4.2">I was able to do so I hope you found</text><text start="824.6" dur="3.039">these videos interesting I guess here at</text><text start="826.24" dur="4.279">the end of part three if you&amp;#39;re still</text><text start="827.639" dur="5.241">watching you probably did uh if you end</text><text start="830.519" dur="5.44">up trying this at home and anybody</text><text start="832.88" dur="5.84">actually gets a Polaris lapse like this</text><text start="835.959" dur="6">one I would love to see it so be sure to</text><text start="838.72" dur="6.84">uh L L it over to my YouTube account or</text><text start="841.959" dur="7.201">mention me on Reddit and uh thanks for</text><text start="845.56" dur="6.32">watching and as soon as it dims away and</text><text start="849.16" dur="4.72">stops emitting any light you turn off</text><text start="851.88" dur="3.72">the uh the camera or close the shutter</text><text start="853.88" dur="4.04">and turn off the camera and you&amp;#39;re done</text><text start="855.6" dur="3.919">capturing your image if all went to plan</text><text start="857.92" dur="3.279">you&amp;#39;ll get some really awesome streak</text><text start="859.519" dur="3.56">images like these where you can see the</text><text start="861.199" dur="3.64">entire path of the flare as it gets</text><text start="863.079" dur="4.081">bright and moves across the sky and then</text><text start="864.839" dur="3.881">Fades away I think they&amp;#39;re pretty cool</text><text start="867.16" dur="3.239">when you&amp;#39;re taking long exposures of the</text><text start="868.72" dur="3.6">night Sky you might even get bonus</text><text start="870.399" dur="4.281">satellites this picture of the flare</text><text start="872.32" dur="4.759">from the satellite aridium 10 also</text><text start="874.68" dur="5.56">captured the trails from two Soviet era</text><text start="877.079" dur="3.161">communication satellites</text></transcript>
