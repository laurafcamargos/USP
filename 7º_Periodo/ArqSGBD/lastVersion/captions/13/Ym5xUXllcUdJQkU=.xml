start="64.92" dur="4.5">to that lies in how we deliver our</text><text start="67.08" dur="5.16">precursor material to our growing</text><text start="69.42" dur="5.16">crystal in an MBE we want to

dur="4.681">controlled manner and when I say slowly</text><text start="78.93" dur="4.74">add material to the surface I mean it</text><text start="81.09" dur="5.13">our normal growth rate is something like</text><text start="83.67" dur="5.909">a monolayer of atoms every three seconds</text><text start="86.22" dur="7.35">at that rate we would need 113 days of</text><text start="89.579" dur="6.961">continuous deposition to make a film one</text><text start="93.57" dur="5.64">millimeter thick we normally grow films</text><text start="96.54" dur="4.59">about 80 nanometers thick so they take</text><text start="99.21" dur="3.51">about a half an hour these really slow</text><text start="101.13" dur="4.05">growth rates are really important to</text><text start="102.72" dur="4.289">give us control over the crystal growth</text><text start="105.18" dur="4.11">process because when things are</text><text start="107.009" dur="5.04">happening very slowly it gives us time</text><text start="109.29" dur="5.189">to react you can think of an MBE sort of</text><text start="112.049" dur="4.32">as a ridiculously precise spray painting</text><text start="114.479" dur="3.18">machine with a bunch of different atoms</text><text start="116.369" dur="3.481">to choose from down here</text><text start="117.659" dur="4.441">spraying up towards the substrate in the</text><text start="119.85" dur="4.53">middle for example if you wanted to grow</text><text start="122.1" dur="4.229">gallium arsenide you&amp;#39;d start spraying</text><text start="124.38" dur="3.449">gallium and arsenic and you&amp;#39;d let them</text><text start="126.329" dur="3.9">stick to the substrate in the correct</text><text start="127.829" dur="3.691">proportion and you provide those atoms</text><text start="130.229" dur="3.121">slowly enough</text><text start="131.52" dur="4.29">so the Adams landing on the substrate</text><text start="133.35" dur="4.65">have time to arrange themselves into an</text><text start="135.81" dur="3.66">ordered crystal structure that means</text><text start="138" dur="4.02">that we need to be able to create a</text><text start="139.47" dur="5.34">stream of

start="147.12" dur="3.87">pressure in the system the molecules of</text><text start="149.4" dur="3.39">precursor would just run into air</text><text start="150.99" dur="3.63">molecules and that would happen pretty</text><text start="152.79" dur="3.36">quick because the mean free path of a</text><text start="154.62" dur="3.93">particle flying through air is only</text><text start="156.15" dur="4.38">about 70 nanometers but we need our</text><text start="158.55" dur="3.81">stream of particles to travel almost a</text><text start="160.53" dur="3.78">metre to get from the source to

dur="4.62">air out of the way so that our stream of</text><text start="180.12" dur="4.2">particles can travel uninhibited how do</text><text start="182.25" dur="4.56">we actually generate such a

dur="3.96">sound very slow but if you think about</text><text start="201.959" dur="5.461">the number of atoms that actually are in</text><text start="204.27" dur="4.95">any individual thing it&amp;#39;s an awful lot I</text><text start="207.42" dur="4.05">also should point out that strictly</text><text start="209.22" dur="5.31">speaking the correct term for a direct</text><text start="211.47" dur="5.94">solid to gas transition is sublimation</text><text start="214.53" dur="5.1">not evaporation but because some MBE</text><text start="217.41" dur="4.41">sources are liquids and

dur="4.2">if you were to put this bolt inside a</text><text start="225.48" dur="4.65">vacuum chamber those 30 million atoms</text><text start="228" dur="3.99">per second that are evaporating from the</text><text start="230.13" dur="4.23">head of the bolt would be able to</text><text start="231.99" dur="4.65">traverse a long distance and deposit</text><text start="234.36" dur="5.49">somewhere

front</text><text start="359.31" dur="3.84">plate with a pinhole that limits the</text><text start="361.139" dur="3.81">material coming out so the first thing</text><text start="363.15" dur="3.6">that

great</text><text start="398.72" dur="4.74">because it meant that I could refill the</text><text start="400.4" dur="5.07">cell exclusively with new extremely pure</text><text start="403.46"

dur="4.8">however that means that we need to be</text><text start="419.09" dur="4.26">absurdly careful not to contaminate it</text><text start="421.76" dur="4.23">with anything because it&amp;#39;s starting</text><text start="423.35" dur="4.38">really really pure in all of the video</text><text start="425.99" dur="3.96">of me working on this the part that you</text><text start="427.73" dur="4.68">really can&amp;#39;t see is how much effort is</text><text start="429.95" dur="4.53">going into imagining you know which hand</text><text start="432.41" dur="3.69">has touched what lasts

here</text><text start="467.39" dur="3.87">you can see that once I got everything</text><text start="469.4" dur="4.59">sorted I&amp;#39;m actually pouring the new</text><text start="471.26"
