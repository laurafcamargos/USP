start="10" dur="5.36">you need to win a majority of those</text><text start="11.799" dur="5.56">votes but 538 is an even number so what</text><text start="15.36" dur="4.88">happens when the race for

dur="4.759">this is an incredibly disp porate system</text><text start="60.8" dur="3.759">because just 10 States California Texas</text><text start="63.079" dur="3.241">New York Florida Illinois Pennsylvania</text><text start="64.559" dur="3.481">Ohio Michigan Georgia and North Carolina</text><text start="66.32" dur="4.08">contain more than half the population of</text><text start="68.04" dur="4.2">the United States but get only 20% of</text><text start="70.4" dur="3.96">the votes if the race for president is</text><text start="72.24" dur="4.4">tied and the other 40 states with less</text><text start="74.36" dur="4.96">than half the population get 80% of the</text><text start="76.64" dur="4.64">votes while an exact tie is unlikely</text><text start="79.32" dur="3.759">this

start="84.72" dur="4.2">Electoral College which is exactly what</text><text start="86.92" dur="4.64">happened when four candidates ran for</text><text start="88.92" dur="4.239">president in 18 24 Andrew Jackson got</text><text start="91.56" dur="3.519">the most votes from Americans and the</text><text start="93.159" dur="4.161">most votes in the Electoral College but</text><text start="95.079" dur="3.841">not a majority so the race was turned</text><text start="97.32" dur="3.72">over to the House of Representatives</text><text start="98.92" dur="4.559">voting as States who picked John

dur="4.04">horrifically disproportionate results</text><text start="107.92" dur="3.479">consider a thirdparty candidate who</text><text start="109.56" dur="3.919">loves the small States and who the

dur="3.119">ensure that neither of the two more</text><text start="116.32" dur="3.68">popular candidates gets a majority so</text><text start="118.119" dur="3.721">now the house decides the winner and</text><text start="120" dur="3.96">those 26 smallest states representing</text><text start="121.84" dur="4.879">just 17% of the population can pick</text><text start="123.96" dur="5.159">their man

shouldn&amp;#39;t even be</text><text start="131.599" dur="3.681">possible anyway all this talk of</text><text start="133.44" dur="3.72">presidents has left the vice president</text><text

when there&amp;#39;s a tie the</text><text start="141.64" dur="4.319">Senate independently picks the vice</text><text start="143.879" dur="4.08">president so the United States could end</text><text

start="156.08" dur="3.04">because there are 100 members of the</text><text start="158.08" dur="2.519">Senate and in the House of</text><text start="159.12" dur="3.88">Representatives they&amp;#39;re

dur="4.8">the whole system tit tacular with all</text><text start="167.64" dur="3.8">those even numbers so if the house can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="170" dur="3.159">pick the president but the
