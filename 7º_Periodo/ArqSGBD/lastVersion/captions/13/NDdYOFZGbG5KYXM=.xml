dur="3.48">trying to take time lapses it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="19.88" dur="3.28">sometimes a really cool effect if the</text><text start="21.4" dur="4">camera&amp;#39;s actually moving while it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="23.16" dur="3.64">recording the timelaps but this is a a</text><text start="25.4" dur="4.68">hard effect to achieve because the</text><text start="26.8" dur="6.24">camera has to move exceptionally slowly</text><text start="30.08" dur="5.44">uh or else it just like Zips through and</text><text start="33.04" dur="4.24">it also needs to move very smoothly so</text><text start="35.52" dur="3.4">the it doesn&amp;#39;t need to be like bouncing</text><text start="37.28" dur="3.16">up and down the whole time that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="38.92" dur="3.4">it&amp;#39;s moving side to side so you have to</text><text start="40.44" dur="3.959">have a mechanism for making it smooth</text><text start="42.32" dur="4.239">and slow if you&amp;#39;re trying to get</text><text start="44.399" dur="4.441">something to move really slowly you need</text><text start="46.559" dur="4.52">a really obscenely high gear ratio and</text><text start="48.84" dur="5.719">the highest gear ratio systems that</text><text start="51.079" dur="6.48">exist are worm gear drives so I have</text><text start="54.559" dur="5.441">this 3ft length of 1/42 threaded Rod</text><text start="57.559" dur="4">because it&amp;#39;s the closest thing to a</text><text start="60" dur="4.32">giant worm gear or lead screw that I</text><text start="61.559" dur="5.441">could get and uh if you put a nut on</text><text start="64.32" dur="5.76">this you can spin it pretty darn quick</text><text start="67" dur="5.6">and uh it moves linearly much more</text><text start="70.08" dur="5.88">slowly than uh than you&amp;#39;re spinning it</text><text start="72.6" dur="6.72">so if you&amp;#39;re trying to take the uh</text><text start="75.96" dur="6.44">rotational uh motion from like a motor</text><text start="79.32" dur="5.24">and make a camera move from one end of</text><text start="82.4" dur="3.44">the slide to the other in about an hour</text><text start="84.56" dur="3.68">that&amp;#39;s your best</text><text start="85.84" dur="3.76">bet so I actually have the rig set up on</text><text start="88.24" dur="3.919">a bench here because I&amp;#39;m about to take a</text><text start="89.6" dur="4.32">picture of of the bell tower but uh this</text><text start="92.159" dur="4">motor assembly on the end is what</text><text start="93.92" dur="3.96">actually like Chucks the threaded rod in</text><text start="96.159" dur="4.681">and Spins it down the whole length of</text><text start="97.88" dur="4.64">the Camera slide and uh I really don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="100.84" dur="3.36">remember where exactly I got it from it</text><text start="102.52" dur="3.36">may have been from like a tape recorder</text><text start="104.2" dur="3.239">or something like that a really long</text><text start="105.88" dur="4">time ago but it was in my big shoe box</text><text start="107.439" dur="5.32">full of motors and it was the thing with</text><text start="109.88" dur="5.44">the highest gear ratio so the back of it</text><text start="112.759" dur="5.601">I soldered on a uh an old USB port which</text><text start="115.32" dur="4.719">means that I can run it off of a uh</text><text start="118.36" dur="3.52">external battery that I&amp;#39;m actually also</text><text start="120.039" dur="5">using to run the camera cuz it&amp;#39;s almost</text><text start="121.88" dur="4.559">dead and uh there are some laser cut</text><text start="125.039" dur="3">Parts on the front right here and</text><text start="126.439" dur="3.96">actually a little piece of plastic that</text><text start="128.039" dur="3.881">is HTP off of a milk carton that whole</text><text start="130.399" dur="4.56">thing fits together and actually holds</text><text start="131.92" dur="5.599">on to a qu or 20 nut that um you like</text><text start="134.959" dur="4.521">double nut the HTP in between and it</text><text start="137.519" dur="5.08">holds on to the threaded Rod so that the</text><text start="139.48" dur="6.3">threaded Rod spins all the way down and</text><text start="142.599" dur="3.661">doesn&amp;#39;t

start="223.879" dur="5.28">sliding time-lapse camera rig I had a</text><text start="227.439" dur="4.401">really simple design it was a single</text><text start="229.159" dur="4.72">piece of PVC and a single quarter2</text><text start="231.84" dur="4.36">threaded rod and they were right on top</text><text start="233.879" dur="3.881">of each other attached at the ends by</text><text start="236.2" dur="4.16">big wooden brackets that would hold them</text><text start="237.76" dur="4.199">where they needed to be and a uh a motor</text><text start="240.36" dur="4">assembly at one end that would actually</text><text start="241.959" dur="4.721">spin the threaded Rod but then down the</text><text start="244.36" dur="5.36">whole length of it um there were just</text><text start="246.68" dur="5.16">these two pieces and wherever the camera</text><text start="249.72" dur="4.12">was the camera was actually attached to</text><text start="251.84" dur="4.32">a thin sheet of plywood it was like</text><text start="253.84" dur="3.959">quarter inch plywood that had two holes</text><text start="256.16" dur="5.88">in it one of which would slide over the</text><text start="257.799" dur="6.561">PVC and one of which would go uh around</text><text start="262.04" dur="4.8">the threaded Rod so you could put a nut</text><text start="264.36" dur="6.119">on the threaded rod and it would push</text><text start="266.84" dur="5.76">this thing all the way down the problem</text><text start="270.479" dur="4.521">is that the threaded Rod bowed</text><text start="272.6" dur="3.879">significantly over like three feet with</text><text start="275" dur="3.16">just a little bit of weight on it if the</text><text start="276.479" dur="4.56">camera would make it lean forward or</text><text start="278.16" dur="4.52">backwards so the camera would be over</text><text start="281.039" dur="3.321">here and then it would go down and it</text><text start="282.68" dur="3.56">would lean forwards as it bent the</text><text start="284.36" dur="3.32">threaded rod and then it would come back</text><text start="286.24" dur="4.28">up at the other end where there was</text><text start="287.68" dur="5.6">another back stop and uh that was</text><text start="290.52" dur="5.88">obviously not an effective solution the</text><text start="293.28" dur="5.68">mark two I guess was really not a</text><text start="296.4" dur="4.079">dramatic change the real problem I was</text><text start="298.96" dur="3.2">trying to solve was the fact that the</text><text start="300.479" dur="3.16">camera would bow in the middle which</text><text start="302.16" dur="3.68">just means that the camera had to be</text><text start="303.639" dur="4.961">supported by something other than the</text><text start="305.84" dur="4.48">threaded rod and to do that this is</text><text start="308.6" dur="3.439">actually that design I&amp;#39;ve taken the</text><text start="310.32" dur="4.64">motor assembly off one end actually</text><text start="312.039" dur="6.521">broke off that end but um it had two</text><text start="314.96" dur="6.92">pieces of PVC and the camera actually</text><text start="318.56" dur="5">had two slot or the mount for the camera</text><text start="321.88" dur="4.599">actually had two slots so it would rest</text><text start="323.56" dur="6.6">on the PVC like that and it could slide</text><text start="326.479" dur="5.201">up and down and it would not b</text><text start="330.16" dur="4.52">back and</text><text start="331.68" dur="4.639">forth the threaded Rod attaches in at</text><text start="334.68" dur="3.28">the top right there so you can put a nut</text><text start="336.319" dur="4.241">on this and the nut binds against the</text><text start="337.96" dur="5">PVC and as you spin the threaded Rod it</text><text start="340.56" dur="4.56">pushes this down the problem as you can</text><text start="342.96" dur="4.72">probably see as I&amp;#39;m pushing this is that</text><text start="345.12" dur="5.48">it really likes to bind there&amp;#39;s a lot of</text><text start="347.68" dur="4.56">friction in this scenario and so it</text><text start="350.6" dur="4.48">wasn&amp;#39;t leaning forwards and backwards</text><text start="352.24" dur="5.2">anymore but it was actually jerking side</text><text start="355.08" dur="3.64">to side as the nut slowly pushed on it</text><text start="357.44" dur="2.56">and it would build up force and it would</text><text start="358.72" dur="3.36">let go and it would build up force it</text><text start="360" dur="4.68">would let go so it was a really jerky</text><text start="362.08" dur="5.72">motion and that was also not an</text><text start="364.68" dur="5.519">effective solution the Mark III however</text><text start="367.8" dur="5.88">was an effective solution so</text><text start="370.199" dur="6.201">conveniently I got to reuse the the</text><text start="373.68" dur="4.4">threaded rod from the first two designs</text><text start="376.4" dur="4.32">I got to reuse the motor assembly from</text><text start="378.08" dur="6.32">the first two designs and of course all</text><text start="380.72" dur="3.68">of the actual camera mounting</text><text start="384.7" dur="9.339">[Applause]</text><text start="387.56" dur="9.24">gear so this is said Mark 3i and uh it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="394.039" dur="5.6">an all wooden track that is made of a</text><text start="396.8" dur="5.08">whole bunch of laminated pieces of laser</text><text start="399.639" dur="5.441">cut plywood this is a design that was</text><text start="401.88" dur="5.039">actually sort of informed by uh watching</text><text start="405.08" dur="3.32">one of the uh Builds on tested where</text><text start="406.919" dur="3.041">they make a sword out of plywood they</text><text start="408.4" dur="3.48">have to laminate a whole bunch of layers</text><text start="409.96" dur="4.4">together in order to keep it flat these</text><text start="411.88" dur="4.24">were all really Bode pieces of plywood</text><text start="414.36" dur="3.239">but when you stick like five layers</text><text start="416.12" dur="4.079">together and use four and a half tubes</text><text start="417.599" dur="5.641">of cyan or acrylate to do it it uh it</text><text start="420.199" dur="5.601">stays pretty darn rigid so uh I was</text><text start="423.24" dur="4.799">happy with how that came out the key to</text><text start="425.8" dur="5.6">controlling the camera is that you have</text><text start="428.039" dur="6.121">to have a low friction slide that does</text><text start="431.4" dur="6.72">not depend on the threaded rod for</text><text start="434.16" dur="5.599">stability so this is the camera Dolly</text><text start="438.12" dur="2.799">it&amp;#39;s got a whole bunch of quarter inch</text><text start="439.759" dur="4.681">holes in the middle so that you can</text><text start="440.919" dur="5.441">stick a bolt through anywhere and attach</text><text start="444.44" dur="4.319">any sort of tripod mounted thing you</text><text start="446.36" dur="4.72">want here I&amp;#39;ve got the GoPro on a little</text><text start="448.759" dur="6.521">like ball socket</text><text start="451.08" dur="6.239">but the uh track is actually made to fit</text><text start="455.28" dur="5">this dolly specifically so the underside</text><text start="457.319" dur="5.44">of this has a bunch of roller skate</text><text start="460.28" dur="7.28">bearings 8 mm like regular buy them on</text><text start="462.759" dur="8.28">Amazon roller skate bearings and the</text><text start="467.56" dur="5.96">track has a raised section in the middle</text><text start="471.039" dur="4.041">that those bearings actually just fit</text><text start="473.52" dur="4.84">around so I&amp;#39;m using the bearings as</text><text start="475.08" dur="5.64">Wheels sort of and uh it SL you can</text><text start="478.36" dur="4.559">actually hear slots into the track right</text><text start="480.72" dur="4.24">there and then it slides very easily</text><text start="482.919" dur="3.321">with some friction cuz I&amp;#39;m not using the</text><text start="484.96" dur="3.679">bearings totally right and they&amp;#39;re sort</text><text start="486.24" dur="4.6">of rubbing on the side but very little</text><text start="488.639" dur="5.161">friction especially compared to the Mark</text><text start="490.84" dur="5.359">I that I was showing a second ago and</text><text start="493.8" dur="4.839">the way you drive this is to just stick</text><text start="496.199" dur="4.921">a threaded rod in</text><text start="498.639" dur="5.201">here and attach it to the motor at the</text><text start="501.12" dur="4.759">end and there&amp;#39;s actually no um I mean</text><text start="503.84" dur="4.52">you can see it&amp;#39;s sliding around and the</text><text start="505.879" dur="5.16">camera is completely fixed without that</text><text start="508.36" dur="5.4">so there is driving it from the threaded</text><text start="511.039" dur="5.36">rod and then you stick the threaded Rod</text><text start="513.76" dur="5.56">into the motor assembly from before same</text><text start="516.399" dur="4.041">motor assembly and you press the button</text><text start="519.32" dur="3.279">and it</text><text start="520.44" dur="3.8">goes the other nice thing about this</text><text start="522.599" dur="3.881">design is that when the dolly reaches</text><text start="524.24" dur="4.159">the end of the piece of threaded Rod it</text><text start="526.48" dur="4.44">just sort of unchuck itself and falls to</text><text start="528.399" dur="2.521">the end of the</text><text start="531.77" dur="6.58">[Music]</text><text start="538.44" dur="35.95">track</text><text start="541.29"
