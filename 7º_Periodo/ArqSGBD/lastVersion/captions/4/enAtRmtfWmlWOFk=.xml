dur="4.721">3:00 a.m. to try to get one more shot</text><text start="17.359" dur="3.441">you&amp;#39;d be right but why was I doing that</text><text start="19.32" dur="3.799">the other day just messing around with</text><text start="20.8" dur="4.84">it I found out that throwing cards looks</text><text start="23.119" dur="3.92">really cool on a high-speed camera and</text><text start="25.64" dur="4.36">that made me want to understand the</text><text start="27.039" dur="5.04">aerodynamics how do cards fly when you</text><text start="30" dur="3.92">throw them because I now finally have a</text><text start="32.079" dur="5.041">tool that will allow me to see these</text><text start="33.92" dur="5.68">things so today I have it all set up in</text><text start="37.12" dur="4.2">the garage and I have three questions</text><text start="39.6" dur="4.119">that I want to answer I want to see the</text><text start="41.32" dur="5.12">air movement over a card Edge on I want</text><text start="43.719" dur="5.401">to analyze it like a wing I also want to</text><text start="46.44" dur="4.799">see the air movement perpendicular to</text><text start="49.12" dur="5.52">the motion of the card and see it like</text><text start="51.239" dur="5.721">make vortices and third I want to</text><text start="54.64" dur="3.879">understand why every time I flick a card</text><text start="56.96" dur="4.2">it sort of does this helical</text><text start="58.519" dur="5.2">loop-de-loop because it drives me</text><text start="61.16" dur="5.12">insane look at that why can&amp;#39;t you

dur="4.16">filming a couple months ago and a lot of</text><text start="70.52" dur="3.04">these shots ended up a lot more</text><text start="72.2" dur="5.08">complicated than I thought they were</text><text start="73.56" dur="3.72">going to be so let&amp;#39;s get into the</text><text start="77.4" dur="5.719">analysis oh God I actually did hit the</text><text start="80.119"

dur="3.48">shots of cards flying through the air</text><text start="104.439" dur="2.761">we&amp;#39;re going to get to those in a bit but</text><text start="105.68" dur="2.799">I want to start with the perpendicular</text><text start="107.2" dur="3.879">shots where the card is actually</text><text start="108.479" dur="7.041">traveling away from the camera one</text><text start="111.079" dur="7.841">because they&amp;#39;re really cool oh</text><text start="115.52" dur="6.919">wow that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m looking for there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="118.92" dur="6.04">so much

dur="3.52">perpendicular shots were actually the</text><text start="128.52" dur="4">last things I recorded for this video</text><text start="130.44" dur="3.799">and that&amp;#39;s what took many hours last</text><text start="132.52" dur="3.719">weekend and the reason for my garage</text><text start="134.239" dur="4.761">being a disaster area and for a number</text><text start="136.239" dur="5.761">of these shots especially after I hurt</text><text start="139" dur="5.68">my elbow I was also cheating for a bad</text><text start="142" dur="4.16">but at least consistently Bad Card throw</text><text start="144.68" dur="3">I found I could set the cards on a</text><text start="146.16" dur="4.32">smooth table and hit them with the</text><text start="147.68" dur="4.76">rubber drum

start="154.599" dur="4.841">the camera was less than repeatable so</text><text start="157.519" dur="3.881">I&amp;#39;ll begrudgingly be giving one point to</text><text start="159.44" dur="3.56">the machines on this one Let&amp;#39;s ignore</text><text start="161.4" dur="3.24">how the card is generating lift right</text><text start="163" dur="3.879">now but hopefully it makes sense that to</text><text start="164.64" dur="4.64">keep itself flying level it actually</text><text start="166.879" dur="4.961">needs to be pushing the air down in the</text><text start="169.28" dur="4.76">absence of any forces except for Gravity</text><text start="171.84" dur="4.96">the card would fly down in a parabolic</text><text start="174.04" dur="4.96">Arc but as the card flies it applies a</text><text start="176.8" dur="4.48">force down on the air and then the air</text><text start="179" dur="4.4">pressure pushes back up on the card to</text><text start="181.28" dur="4.4">counter gravity the awesome thing is</text><text start="183.4" dur="4.399">that when the card passes through fog we</text><text start="185.68" dur="4.36">can see that the air appears to get</text><text start="187.799" dur="5.121">pushed down below the card and the air</text><text start="190.04" dur="5.759">above the card then scoots down to fill</text><text start="192.92" dur="5.48">that leftover space long after the card</text><text start="195.799" dur="4.761">has passed by the air column it affected</text><text start="198.4" dur="4.479">is still dropping down but what&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="200.56" dur="4.72">scope with these spirals turns out that</text><text start="202.879" dur="4.681">we get spiral patterns like this every</text><text start="205.28" dur="6.76">time that a wing is generating lift and</text><text start="207.56" dur="7.12">that Wing isn&amp;#39;t infinitely long so all</text><text start="212.04" dur="4.72">wings in actual airplane design these</text><text start="214.68" dur="4.24">are called wing tip vortices because</text><text start="216.76" dur="4.839">they are vortices that</text><text start="218.92" dur="4.28">occur at the wing tips if you&amp;#39;ve ever</text><text start="221.599" dur="3.64">seen one of these sideways diagrams</text><text start="223.2" dur="4.399">showing the air moving around a wing</text><text start="225.239" dur="5.761">that&amp;#39;s a picture that really only holds</text><text start="227.599" dur="5.72">perfectly in 2D as the air hits the wing</text><text start="231" dur="4.68">and compresses under the wing it</text><text start="233.319" dur="4.601">generates a high pressure Zone and as</text><text start="235.68" dur="4.119">the air passes by the wing above or if</text><text start="237.92" dur="4.72">you want to think about it as pulling</text><text start="239.799" dur="5.201">the wing away from the air above you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="242.64" dur="4.08">generating a lower pressure region above</text><text start="245" dur="3.68">the wing this means that even though</text><text start="246.72" dur="3.599">there&amp;#39;s still air pressure everywhere</text><text start="248.68" dur="3.839">the total force on the bottom of the</text><text start="250.319" dur="3.881">wing has increased slightly and the</text><text start="252.519" dur="4.081">total Force pushing on the top of the</text><text start="254.2" dur="5.159">wing has decreased slightly and the</text><text start="256.6" dur="4.44">difference in these forces is lift now</text><text start="259.359" dur="3.681">if you stack a bunch of these diagrams</text><text start="261.04" dur="4.439">next to each other we&amp;#39;ve got a lot of</text><text start="263.04" dur="4.52">area of wing at high pressure down here</text><text start="265.479" dur="4.72">and a lot of area of wing with low</text><text start="267.56" dur="4.88">pressure on top the bigger the wing the</text><text start="270.199" dur="5.401">more you can lift but what&amp;#39;s happening</text><text start="272.44" dur="4.96">to the air next to the wing next to the</text><text start="275.6" dur="3.439">wing there&amp;#39;s nothing to inhibit the air</text><text start="277.4" dur="4.04">flow so we&amp;#39;re looking at an empty</text><text start="279.039" dur="4.321">cross-section here the pressure is</text><text start="281.44" dur="5">whatever it was when it started this</text><text start="283.36" dur="5.119">shouldn&amp;#39;t surprise anybody it&amp;#39;s just air</text><text start="286.44" dur="3.92">like without stuff moving through it the</text><text start="288.479" dur="4.121">fun happens when we stack a couple of</text><text start="290.36" dur="4.72">those empty two-dimensional frames next</text><text start="292.6" dur="4.76">to our wing generating lift</text><text start="295.08" dur="4.64">two-dimensional frames suddenly we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="297.36" dur="4.2">broken the Symmetry we have this high</text><text start="299.72" dur="3.84">pressure zone right next to the regular</text><text start="301.56" dur="4.04">Zone some of that high pressure air is</text><text start="303.56" dur="4.96">going to leak out from under the wing</text><text start="305.6" dur="4.8">sideways likewise the regular air from</text><text start="308.52" dur="4.2">next to the wing is going to leak into</text><text start="310.4" dur="5.04">the rarified region above the tip of the</text><text start="312.72" dur="5.96">wing on the top this sets up a circular</text><text start="315.44" dur="5.92">motion that must occur at the end of any</text><text start="318.68" dur="4.68">3D object that generates lift the trick</text><text start="321.36" dur="4.679">with the card is that it&amp;#39;s so narrow</text><text start="323.36" dur="5.08">it&amp;#39;s almost all Vortex it&amp;#39;s a really</text><text start="326.039" dur="4.761">short wing and we see these two enormous</text><text start="328.44" dur="4.68">wing tip vortices being Shed from the</text><text start="330.8" dur="4.6">edges of the card as it passes through</text><text start="333.12" dur="4.16">the sheet of fog if you look closely you</text><text start="335.4" dur="4.48">can also see little mini vortices</text><text start="337.28" dur="4.199">forming at the edge of the main Vortex I</text><text start="339.88" dur="3.12">feel like in a clean enough system you</text><text start="341.479" dur="3.401">could get these little instabilities on</text><text start="343" dur="3.8">instabilities on instabilities all the</text><text start="344.88" dur="4.4">way down if it wasn&amp;#39;t for the Reynolds</text><text start="346.8" dur="4">number changing as you scale smaller it</text><text start="349.28" dur="3.479">would actually be really fun to try to</text><text start="350.8" dur="4.36">calculate how many levels of</text><text start="352.759" dur="5.28">instabilities you could get for any</text><text start="355.16" dur="5.2">given air density and temperature and</text><text start="358.039" dur="4.401">like scale of card but I&amp;#39;m not going to</text><text start="360.36" dur="3.76">do that math today now where I started</text><text start="362.44" dur="3.36">with all this filming were the edge on</text><text start="364.12" dur="3.96">shots where we actually get to see the</text><text start="365.8" dur="6">card behaving like a wing traveling</text><text start="368.08" dur="5.679">through the air okay I think it&amp;#39;s set up</text><text start="371.8" dur="4.08">and these shots also demonstrate some</text><text start="373.759" dur="3.761">very cool instabilities they were a bit</text><text start="375.88" dur="3.4">of a challenge as well because while the</text><text start="377.52" dur="3.64">Dremel is a lot better than I am at</text><text start="379.28" dur="3.72">getting the card to go to the same place</text><text start="381.16" dur="3.439">every time I wanted to get a few</text><text start="383" dur="3.96">different angles of attack and that was</text><text start="384.599" dur="5.121">basically totally random so it was a lot</text><text start="386.96" dur="4.44">of starting the fog shooting a card stop</text><text start="389.72" dur="5.96">in the fog running back to the camera</text><text start="391.4" dur="5.799">rinse and repeat oh there&amp;#39;s the card the</text><text start="395.68" dur="3.68">first point I want to make here is</text><text start="397.199" dur="4.681">actually best viewed at a less severe</text><text start="399.36" dur="5.64">slowdown and that&amp;#39;s the total movement</text><text start="401.88" dur="4.92">of air after the card passes by since</text><text start="405" dur="3.759">we&amp;#39;re looking at sort of the entire air</text><text start="406.8" dur="5.16">column here we&amp;#39;re not seeing the wing</text><text start="408.759" dur="6.481">tip vortices as clearly but we do see</text><text start="411.96" dur="6.16">all the air shift down after the card</text><text start="415.24" dur="4.92">goes through okay editing Brian here I</text><text start="418.12" dur="4.6">was going to leave this as like an</text><text start="420.16" dur="4.4">onscreen note but it was so cool</text><text start="422.72" dur="3.64">sometimes napkin math really surprises</text><text start="424.56" dur="3.88">you that I needed to talk about it</text><text start="426.36" dur="4.399">knowing the frame rate of this footage I</text><text start="428.44" dur="5.759">can calculate that this card takes about</text><text start="430.759" dur="5.28">13 milliseconds to travel its own length</text><text start="434.199" dur="5.521">in this footage which means that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="436.039" dur="6.681">actually traveling about 6.8 m/ second</text><text start="439.72" dur="4.159">sideways if acted upon by gravity alone</text><text start="442.72" dur="2.759">of course this card would not be</text><text start="443.879" dur="3.72">traveling in a straight line sideways it</text><text start="445.479" dur="5.28">would be sort of following an arc</text><text start="447.599" dur="6.521">downwards and we can say that in that 13</text><text start="450.759" dur="5.761">milliseconds between right here and I</text><text start="454.12" dur="4.24">don&amp;#39;t know right here then this card</text><text start="456.52" dur="3.92">would have accelerated downwards by</text><text start="458.36" dur="4.8">about an eighth of a meter per second so</text><text start="460.44" dur="4.039">if it started heading downwards at 0 m/</text><text start="463.16" dur="3.52">second at the end of this 13</text><text start="464.479" dur="3.961">milliseconds it would then be falling at</text><text start="466.68" dur="3.88">an eighth of a meter per second if we</text><text start="468.44" dur="3.68">assume that this playing card weighs 5</text><text start="470.56" dur="3.639">gr which I found somewhere on the</text><text start="472.12" dur="4.919">internet as like the typical mass of a</text><text start="474.199" dur="4.801">playing card we can calculate that in</text><text start="477.039" dur="7">that 13 milliseconds when it accelerates</text><text start="479" dur="8.08">downwards it would have gained 64 G cm/</text><text start="484.039" dur="4.761">second of downwards momentum that&amp;#39;s what</text><text start="487.08" dur="3.76">gravity would have done by itself now</text><text start="488.8" dur="3.48">with some extremely vague estimates I</text><text start="490.84" dur="4.16">needed to measure the momentum of the</text><text start="492.28" dur="4.56">air so I measured the speed of this down</text><text start="495" dur="3.72">wash which you can do in the video</text><text start="496.84" dur="4">footage relatively easily using the card</text><text start="498.72" dur="5.08">as a ruler that air starts moving</text><text start="500.84" dur="4.96">downwards at about 8 m/ Second and</text><text start="503.8" dur="4.519">although we can only see the air with</text><text start="505.8" dur="4.16">fog in it I assumed that the card was</text><text start="508.319" dur="3.56">interacting with a volume of air that</text><text start="509.96" dur="3.999">was about as big as it was if we</text><text start="511.879" dur="4.441">literally just add up all the momentum</text><text start="513.959" dur="7.2">in this little hypothetical box of air</text><text start="516.32" dur="9.639">we get 70 G centim per second that is so</text><text start="521.159" dur="7.041">close 70 and 64 from the from the back</text><text start="525.959" dur="3.961">so excited I can&amp;#39;t even speak from the</text><text start="528.2" dur="4.48">physics perspective where we&amp;#39;ve made all</text><text start="529.92" dur="4.64">of these really gross assumptions about</text><text start="532.68" dur="3.76">how much air is moving and how fast it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="534.56" dur="3.36">going and all it&amp;#39;s all all the air in</text><text start="536.44" dur="3">the box is going the exact same speed</text><text start="537.92" dur="3.32">it&amp;#39;s not interacting with anything else</text><text start="539.44" dur="4.16">we shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to get this close</text><text start="541.24" dur="4.599">it&amp;#39;s less than 10% error in physics you</text><text start="543.6" dur="4.96">can get an awful lot done by remembering</text><text start="545.839" dur="4.761">some basic conservation laws and then</text><text start="548.56" dur="3.48">figuring out where all of your energy or</text><text start="550.6" dur="3.64">your momentum or whatever other</text><text start="552.04" dur="4.239">invariant you&amp;#39;re working with is going</text><text start="554.24" dur="3.96">in this case gravity didn&amp;#39;t seem to be</text><text start="556.279" dur="4.481">changing the momentum of the card but</text><text start="558.2" dur="6.319">gravity was still on and that momentum</text><text start="560.76" dur="6.519">had to go somewhere and it went into the</text><text start="564.519" dur="5.721">air I think that&amp;#39;s pretty cool now back</text><text start="567.279" dur="4.601">to your regularly scripted video the</text><text start="570.24" dur="4.48">more fun bit here is actually what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="571.88" dur="5.079">happening directly behind the card I</text><text start="574.72" dur="4.72">believe this is a form of Carmen Vortex</text><text start="576.959" dur="4.481">Street it&amp;#39;s a weird State halfway in</text><text start="579.44" dur="4.6">between turbulent and laminer flow where</text><text start="581.44" dur="4.8">the motion of a fluid is predictably</text><text start="584.04" dur="4.039">oscillating these left over Circles of</text><text start="586.24" dur="3.56">air aren&amp;#39;t the same vortices as the wing</text><text start="588.079" dur="4.641">tip vortices these are

dur="4.44">Reynolds numbers if the card was going</text><text start="596.959" dur="4.681">much slower the air would go around it</text><text start="599.36" dur="4.52">smoothly and if the card was

dur="4.44">but we are lucky enough that a card</text><text start="607.88" dur="5">traveling through fog at regular human</text><text start="610.279" dur="4.641">rated speeds and temperatures it
