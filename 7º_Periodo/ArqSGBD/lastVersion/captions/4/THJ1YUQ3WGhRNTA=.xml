can</text><text start="286.35" dur="2.76">prevent forest fires</text><text start="287.43" dur="3.63">that&amp;#39;s the Forest Service because she</text><text start="289.11" dur="4.47">deals with these kinds of fires as well</text><text start="291.06" dur="4.65">as these kinds of fires and it&amp;#39;s a job</text><text start="293.58" dur="5.16">she splits with the last and the

California</text><text start="307.2" dur="4.89">our federal land BLM does a lot and is</text><text start="310.29" dur="4.23">the biggest which can make it very</text><text start="312.09" dur="3.99">confusing about which agency does what</text><text start="314.52" dur="4.2">but think of it this way there are three</text><text start="316.08" dur="4.8">goals conservation recreation extraction</text><text start="318.72" dur="4.11">BLM does all three FS does conservation</text><text start="320.88" dur="4.11">and extraction F and W does conservation</text><text start="322.83" dur="5.58">NPS conservation recreation again in</text><text start="324.99" dur="5.25">general these four plus war control 97%</text><text start="328.41" dur="4.23">of federal land the last three percent</text><text start="330.24" dur="4.38">is miscellaneous used by departments</text><text start="332.64" dur="4.11">like the Postal Service or NASA or the</text><text start="334.62" dur="4.14">Department of Energy or others okay this</text><text start="336.75" dur="4.32">is lovely but like what does it mean to</text><text start="338.76" dur="4.74">say that land is federal is it part of</text><text start="341.07" dur="4.68">the state or not well this brings up the</text><text start="343.5" dur="4.35">delicate and sensitive balance of power</text><text start="345.75" dur="3.39">between the States and America and</text><text start="347.85" dur="3.9">there&amp;#39;s an enormous amount of words</text><text start="349.14" dur="5.22">words words around the sovereignty of</text><text start="351.75" dur="5.28">governments but ultimately federal land</text><text start="354.36" dur="4.83">belongs to America and she can do with</text><text start="357.03" dur="4.08">it what she wants and the states have to</text><text start="359.19" dur="4.05">just suck it most starkly in Nevada</text><text start="361.11" dur="5.61">where federal land was used for nuclear</text><text start="363.24" dur="5.97">bomb testing yeah that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="366.72" dur="10.55">pretty big hole you punched in nevada</text><text

the most extreme example</text><text start="383.73" dur="3.96">but federal lands will often have their</text><text start="385.86" dur="3.87">own separate federal law enforcement</text><text start="387.69" dur="4.47">officers like the investigative services</text><text start="389.73" dur="4.98">branch a kind of FBI for national parks</text><text start="392.16" dur="4.5">though state borders do matter here for</text><text start="394.71" dur="4.05">lesser crimes federal officers will</text><text start="396.66" dur="3.99">often dump suspects into the state</text><text start="398.76"

dur="4.62">around and in between developed and</text><text start="416.34" dur="4.44">undeveloped areas there&amp;#39;s also military</text><text start="418.8" dur="4.08">bases which will have soldiers living in</text><text start="420.78" dur="4.32">them but they can&amp;#39;t own anything and</text><text start="422.88" dur="4.08">because it&amp;#39;s federal land the Department</text><text
