the</text><text start="4.92" dur="3.54">content that you see on this channel is</text><text start="6.839" dur="3.961">in my office which is on the second</text><text start="8.46" dur="4.74">floor next

start="15.12" dur="5.4">the big six terabyte raid that actually</text><text start="17.58" dur="4.68">God needs to get bigger is at the other</text><text start="20.52" dur="3.96">end of the house on the first floor</text><text start="22.26" dur="4.2">literally in the opposite corner and</text><text start="24.48" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s only connected to the network via</text><text start="26.46" dur="5.52">Wi-Fi if you can imagine moving hundreds</text><text start="28.8" dur="5.4">of gigabytes of footage via this USB</text><text start="31.98" dur="4.28">Wi-Fi dongle through a television and</text><text start="34.2" dur="4.8">like eight walls you can see the problem</text><text start="36.26" dur="3.58">also that one downstairs is the gaming</text><text start="39"

the</text><text start="54.719" dur="4.02">office on the second floor to the attic</text><text start="56.52" dur="3.78">was relatively easy I put a hole in the</text><text start="58.739" dur="3.901">ceiling in the closet of the office and</text><text start="60.3" dur="4.92">I just sent the cable down unfortunately</text><text start="62.64" dur="5.04">the other end of the cable that needed</text><text start="65.22" dur="5.939">to end up two stories down in the living</text><text start="67.68" dur="5.82">room wall was more of a pain</text><text start="71.159" dur="5.64">I would need to from here in the Attic</text><text start="73.5" dur="6.56">drill down through two stories of</text><text start="76.799" dur="5.941">external wall and then somehow magically</text><text start="80.06" dur="4.3">catch that cable through a tiny hole</text><text start="82.74" dur="5.1">that I drill in the wall behind the TV</text><text start="84.36" dur="6.299">and that for a number of reasons is not</text><text start="87.84" dur="5.58">going to happen this led me to what is</text><text start="90.659" dur="5.581">without a doubt the most bizarre Home</text><text start="93.42" dur="6.18">Improvement technique that I have ever</text><text start="96.24" dur="5.4">tried to implement running ethernet</text><text start="99.6" dur="4.379">through the HVAC</text><text start="101.64" dur="5.22">also this channel totally started as</text><text start="103.979" dur="4.801">maker style project so despite the fact</text><text start="106.86" dur="3.48">that I&amp;#39;m not like doing something with</text><text start="108.78" dur="3.9">electricity this is actually still</text><text start="110.34" dur="4.5">totally on brain theoretically you could</text><text start="112.68" dur="4.68">route a cable from the attic to any room</text><text start="114.84" dur="4.559">in the house using this technique you</text><text start="117.36" dur="5.42">just have to be able to figure out which</text><text start="119.399" dur="5.82">duct goes to which room this big duct</text><text start="122.78" dur="5.259">exits here and it goes down through a</text><text start="125.219" dur="5.1">hole in what is now the floor goes down</text><text start="128.039" dur="4.681">two stories I believe into a big</text><text start="130.319" dur="4.621">rectangular box that acts as a manifold</text><text start="132.72" dur="4.019">from that manifold you&amp;#39;ve got a whole</text><text start="134.94" dur="4.82">bunch of little tubes that go out to</text><text start="136.739" dur="6.241">every room so what I&amp;#39;ve done is block up</text><text start="139.76" dur="5.44">all of the air vents on the first floor</text><text start="142.98" dur="3.78">that aren&amp;#39;t the one in the living room</text><text start="145.2" dur="3.84">right next to the computer</text><text start="146.76" dur="3.9">that means that all of the airflow that</text><text start="149.04" dur="4.62">comes out of this unit when I turn the</text><text start="150.66" dur="5.52">fan on is going to go through here down</text><text start="153.66" dur="4.32">into the big manifold all of it into</text><text start="156.18" dur="3.9">that manifold is going to be directed</text><text start="157.98" dur="4.92">out through the same ducts which is</text><text start="160.08" dur="4.92">going to come out in the living room</text><text start="162.9" dur="3.78">air moves on its Journey from the attic</text><text start="165" dur="4.4">to the living room it&amp;#39;s going to be</text><text start="166.68" dur="2.72">carrying with it</text><text start="170.459" dur="5.28">the grocery bag and I have tied it to a</text><text start="173.4" dur="3.839">piece of nylon cord so I just pulled</text><text start="175.739" dur="3.181">this out of the toolbox I&amp;#39;m actually</text><text start="177.239" dur="4.681">really glad that I went for the nylon</text><text start="178.92" dur="5.28">and not the sort of 20 cord because this</text><text start="181.92" dur="5.22">actually pulls really hard through the</text><text start="184.2" dur="5.46">vents once I insert this parachute into</text><text start="187.14" dur="4.44">the duct all of the air that&amp;#39;s coming</text><text start="189.66" dur="3.9">from this fan is going to be moving this</text><text start="191.58" dur="5.4">way and it&amp;#39;s actually going to inflate</text><text start="193.56" dur="6.959">the bag so the bag is going to fill the</text><text start="196.98" dur="5.1">entire area of the round duct so I</text><text start="200.519" dur="3.541">actually don&amp;#39;t know how big this duct is</text><text start="202.08" dur="4.799">because it&amp;#39;s covered in insulation but</text><text start="204.06" dur="5.88">if it is an eight inch diameter duct</text><text start="206.879" dur="4.621">which feels likely then 16 square inches</text><text start="209.94" dur="3.78">times pi is going to give you the</text><text start="211.5" dur="5.94">cross-sectional area of that duct and if</text><text start="213.72" dur="6">this fan can manage a tenth of a PSI of</text><text start="217.44" dur="4.56">pressure that tenth of a PSI multiplied</text><text start="219.72" dur="4.32">by the area of that eight inch duct is</text><text start="222" dur="3.84">going to be five pounds so it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="224.04" dur="4.259">be like dropping a five pound weight</text><text start="225.84" dur="4.08">when I put this parachute into this tube</text><text start="228.299" dur="3.3">it&amp;#39;s going to pull pretty hard I have no</text><text start="229.92" dur="3.48">idea what the actual pressure is but a</text><text start="231.599" dur="3.121">tenth of a PSI seems kind of reasonable</text><text start="233.4" dur="2.88">and for all of the people that write</text><text start="234.72" dur="4.14">comments that I need to use metric for</text><text start="236.28" dur="5.64">absolutely everything that would be 689</text><text start="238.86" dur="4.799">pascals I have no idea how much pressure</text><text start="241.92" dur="2.23">this unit actually puts out so it really</text><text start="243.659" dur="7.25">doesn&amp;#39;t matter</text><text start="244.15" dur="6.759">[Music]</text><text start="253.319" dur="7.82">oh God you can hear it inflate</text><text start="257.22" dur="3.919">this is pulling really hard</text><text start="264.36" dur="4.559">so ridiculous</text><text start="267.12" dur="3.54">it&amp;#39;s going oh</text><text start="268.919" dur="4.081">no sorry that was it going through the</text><text start="270.66" dur="5.539">manifold</text><text start="273"

attach</text><text start="315.9" dur="3.9">the end of the ethernet cable to the</text><text start="317.58" dur="4.38">string and pull it through I won&amp;#39;t say</text><text start="319.8" dur="3.839">that that was easy but I will say that</text><text start="321.96" dur="4.62">it was less photogenic so I&amp;#39;m gonna</text><text start="323.639" dur="4.62">gloss over it the final step is of</text><text start="326.58" dur="3.3">course to try to make it look nice and</text><text start="328.259" dur="3.72">anchor the whole thing to the ceiling</text><text start="329.88" dur="4.64">and
