from the</text><text start="180.48" dur="5.1">finish line so at some level the water</text><text start="182.459" dur="4.56">is clearly solving the maze now it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="185.58"

that</text><text start="225.12" dur="3.96">reveals the solution but why does this</text><text start="227.099" dur="4.86">happen if we look at an individual</text><text start="229.08" dur="5.46">Junction water flows in from here and</text><text start="231.959" dur="5.401">water could flow out from either here or</text><text start="234.54" dur="4.74">here if we look really closely the water</text><text start="237.36" dur="4.439">level on this side the incorrect</text><text start="239.28" dur="5.28">direction is the same as the input water</text><text start="241.799"

that&amp;#39;s why the water</text><text start="250.08" dur="4.439">flows this way it&amp;#39;s just gravity and</text><text start="252.299" dur="4.44">water flows downhill even when that Hill</text><text start="254.519" dur="3.601">is made out of other water this brings</text><text start="256.739" dur="3.12">up an interesting point though because</text><text start="258.12" dur="3.899">if we look at the water level at the</text><text start="259.859" dur="4.741">input to the Maze and the water level at</text><text start="262.019" dur="5.221">the output of the maze clearly there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="264.6" dur="5.159">change in fact the whole correct path of</text><text start="267.24" dur="4.38">the maze has a steadily decreasing water</text><text start="269.759" dur="5.041">level that&amp;#39;s continuing to make the</text><text start="271.62" dur="5.88">water flow solving this maze takes 110</text><text start="274.8" dur="5.28">steps so if we assume for simplicity&amp;#39;s</text><text start="277.5" dur="4.979">sake that the water level drops from 110</text><text start="280.08" dur="4.2">into zero throughout the Maze and we</text><text start="282.479" dur="4.141">assume that someone took the time to</text><text start="284.28" dur="4.859">type all this into Excel by hand it</text><text start="286.62" dur="4.5">would look something like this we see a</text><text start="289.139" dur="4.5">steady decline in water level from start</text><text start="291.12" dur="5.16">to finish along the solution path but</text><text start="293.639" dur="4.801">now what do we do about the rest of it</text><text start="296.28" dur="3.66">there are some weird things happening in</text><text start="298.44" dur="3.539">the real experiment in the rest of the</text><text start="299.94" dur="4.08">maze if we look at this wall right here</text><text start="301.979" dur="4.44">this water isn&amp;#39;t moving and this water</text><text start="304.02" dur="4.56">isn&amp;#39;t moving but there&amp;#39;s a huge step in</text><text start="306.419" dur="4.141">water height between them so let&amp;#39;s zoom</text><text start="308.58" dur="3.839">in on that Junction from before we know</text><text start="310.56" dur="3.96">the water was flowing around this Bend</text><text start="312.419" dur="4.321">and there wasn&amp;#39;t any water flowing from</text><text start="314.52" dur="4.98">this cell to this cell meaning the water</text><text start="316.74" dur="4.98">in both had to be the same height this</text><text start="319.5" dur="4.56">region is only connected to the solution</text><text start="321.72" dur="4.8">path at a single location other than</text><text start="324.06" dur="4.5">that it&amp;#39;s totally sealed off intuitively</text><text start="326.52" dur="4.14">then we know that water can&amp;#39;t actually</text><text start="328.56" dur="3.96">be flowing into this region or it would</text><text start="330.66" dur="3.78">eventually overfill because there&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="332.52" dur="3.899">output but physically speaking if</text><text start="334.44" dur="3.72">there&amp;#39;s no water flowing anywhere within</text><text start="336.419" dur="4.261">this region that means the water level</text><text start="338.16" dur="4.92">has to be exactly the same everywhere</text><text start="340.68" dur="4.32">within this boundary if there was any</text><text start="343.08" dur="3.54">difference in height gravity would cause</text><text start="345" dur="3.479">some sloshing that would very quickly</text><text start="346.62" dur="3.78">flatten everything out the cool thing is</text><text start="348.479" dur="4.44">that now we can do this for every extra</text><text start="350.4" dur="4.56">chunk the water level descends down the</text><text start="352.919" dur="4.681">primary path and as long as there&amp;#39;s only</text><text start="354.96" dur="4.799">one solution to the maze everywhere else</text><text start="357.6" dur="4.5">in the Maze can be thought of as part of</text><text start="359.759" dur="4.021">one of these

start="365.639" dur="4.681">down the main path descends and every</text><text start="368.16" dur="3.78">isolated chunk becomes a Mesa that</text><text start="370.32" dur="3.599">adopts the height of the water wherever</text><text start="371.94" dur="3.84">it connects to the primary path it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="373.919" dur="3.78">like a whole bunch of stagnant Lakes</text><text start="375.78" dur="3.96">connected to the same river</text><text start="377.699" dur="3.901">if we look at the example from earlier</text><text start="379.74" dur="3.959">with the really deep bit next to the</text><text start="381.6" dur="3.539">really shallow bit we can see that the</text><text start="383.699" dur="3.78">Deep part connects to the solution</text><text start="385.139" dur="4.021">pretty early on and the really shallow</text><text start="387.479" dur="4.201">part doesn&amp;#39;t connect to the solution</text><text start="389.16" dur="4.68">until the very end of the

dur="6.06">saying yeah sure that describes what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="398.16" dur="5.64">happening but why does it do that and to</text><text start="401.58" dur="4.559">understand that we need to try to</text><text start="403.8" dur="4.56">perturb this system change it and see</text><text start="406.139" dur="4.141">what happens if we add a bit of extra</text><text start="408.36" dur="3.899">water to one of these zones when we</text><text start="410.28" dur="3.9">raise the water level now at this</text><text start="412.259" dur="4.321">Junction we have water flowing out of</text><text start="414.18" dur="4.44">the enclosed Zone which easily flows</text><text start="416.58" dur="4.26">towards the finish and backs up towards</text><text start="418.62" dur="4.139">the

dur="4.619">flow is only proceeding down the main</text><text start="432.72" dur="3.72">Channel and it&amp;#39;s worth noting that the</text><text start="434.639" dur="3.481">same thing happens in

to</text><text start="447.96" dur="4.38">anthropomorphize systems so it wouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="450.12" dur="4.74">be out of place for me to say the system</text><text start="452.34" dur="5.4">wants to be in equilibrium or it likes</text><text start="454.86" dur="4.92">having this particular set of flows but</text><text start="457.74" dur="4.56">the more accurate way to phrase it is</text><text start="459.78" dur="4.74">that anytime we change this system there</text><text start="462.3" dur="4.799">is a physical mechanism in place to</text><text start="464.52" dur="5.28">reverse that change if you add water</text><text start="467.099" dur="5.401">anywhere in this system you&amp;#39;ll find that</text><text start="469.8" dur="4.5">the output flow goes up while the input</text><text start="472.5" dur="3.72">flow stays constant which means that</text><text start="474.3" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;ll end up emptying out that extra</text><text start="476.22"

dur="2.48">didn&amp;#39;t try</text><text start="672.18" dur="4.44">okay so now I have tapped into this maze</text><text start="674.519" dur="3.961">with this oscilloscope and I think that</text><text

the</text><text start="957.6" dur="5.46">maze in contrast electricity tells a</text><text start="960.839" dur="3.901">very different story if you look at this</text><text start="963.06"
