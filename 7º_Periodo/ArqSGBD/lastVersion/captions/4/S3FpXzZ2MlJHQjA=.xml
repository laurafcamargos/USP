dur="5.321">is where it gets interesting n is is not</text><text start="60.96" dur="5">prime so the way you construct caricel</text><text start="63.68" dur="4.72">numbers is you build them out of prime</text><text start="65.96" dur="4.6">factors which have a special property</text><text start="68.4" dur="4.44">but the problem is it&amp;#39;s difficult to say</text><text start="70.56" dur="4.16">in advance how many prime factors these</text><text start="72.84" dur="4.12">numbers will have without knowing how</text><text start="74.72" dur="4.6">many prime factors they have

dur="3.921">that for every large number there exists</text><text start="85.32" dur="4">a prime between that number and its</text><text start="87.04" dur="5.719">double and so we would like to say the</text><text start="89.32" dur="3.439">same thing as true for car Michel</text><text start="92.92" dur="6">numbers so what I did is I made use of</text><text start="96.92" dur="4.08">this great breakthrough from a few years</text><text start="98.92" dur="3.92">ago by jeang and mayard which was</text><text start="101" dur="4.32">actually about looking at small gaps</text><text start="102.84"

the problem but</text><text start="110.799" dur="3.561">none of them went anywhere until I</text><text start="112.479" dur="4.521">realized that I could use these results</text><text start="114.36" dur="4.6">about gaps between primes and I was able</text><text start="117" dur="3.68">to apply that to the study of carmichel</text><text start="118.96" dur="4.079">numbers</text><text start="120.68" dur="4.52">I showed that for sufficiently large n</text><text start="123.039" dur="3.561">there exist carel numbers between n and</text><text start="125.2" dur="4.6">2</text><text start="126.6"

who is one of the</text><text start="134.12" dur="4.8">leading experts on this field I got this</text><text start="136.36" dur="5.04">manuscript from a person I didn&amp;#39;t know</text><text

is</text><text start="155.08" dur="4.879">interesting about my proof is that it</text><text start="157.16" dur="5.6">really relies on Foria analysis which is</text><text start="159.959" dur="5.64">a

of</text><text start="182.44" dur="5.6">subsets of the objects and so that gives</text><text start="185.159" dur="6.16">you this sort of tree of possibilities</text><text start="188.04"
