start="354.36" dur="3.399">every once in a while whenever they feel</text><text start="356.16" dur="4.36">like it those little bundles of energy</text><text start="357.759" dur="5.601">decide to

start="378.28" dur="5.319">we have a photon of the correct energy</text><text start="380.84" dur="5.4">passing by as that Photon passes our</text><text start="383.599" dur="5.641">miniature battery the battery depletes</text><text start="386.24" dur="5.04">and emits a second Photon critically one</text><text start="389.24" dur="4.399">that matches the incident Photon in</text><text

basically like the incident light</text><text start="398" dur="3.919">was just doubled in intensity now</text><text start="400.44" dur="3.199">imagine that you&amp;#39;ve got a whole bunch of</text><text start="401.919" dur="4.361">these little batteries all lined up in a</text><text start="403.639" dur="4.161">row if you just wait and sit there and</text><text start="406.28" dur="3.28">let them emit light whenever they want</text><text start="407.8" dur="4.2">to you&amp;#39;re going to get a whole bunch of</text><text start="409.56" dur="4.32">random photons but if you

the</text><text start="423" dur="4.759">emission of optical radiation in</text><text start="425.479" dur="4.321">practice this is accomplished by placing</text><text start="427.759" dur="4.081">all of your energy in between two</text><text start="429.8" dur="4.2">parallel mirrors the light bounces back</text><text start="431.84" dur="4.199">and forth and back and forth soaking up</text><text start="434" dur="3.879">more energy the whole time and every</text><text start="436.039" dur="4.28">time that it bounces you let a little</text><text start="437.879" dur="4.641">bit of it out one end and it can go and</text><text start="440.319" dur="4.361">like burn stuff so let me ask you one</text><text start="442.52" dur="4.359">more question what do you think happens</text><text start="444.68" dur="4.959">when we have a dead battery and we send</text><text start="446.879" dur="5.201">a photon past it unfortunately that pass</text><text start="449.639" dur="4.601">ing Photon can actually charge the</text><text start="452.08" dur="4.679">battery and then whenever the battery</text><text start="454.24" dur="4.88">decides to randomly Reit its light it</text><text start="456.759" dur="4.88">does so in a random Direction taking a</text><text start="459.12" dur="4.84">photon away from your oriented beam and</text><text start="461.639" dur="4.201">shooting it off

dur="4.399">where are you putting your energy before</text><text start="481.12" dur="5.16">you transform it all into light in order</text><text start="483.479" dur="4.921">for a laser to work and actually amplify</text><text start="486.28" dur="3.96">the light passing through it it needs to</text><text start="488.4" dur="5.44">have more charged batteries than</text><text start="490.24" dur="6.399">uncharged batteries in it all the time</text><text start="493.84" dur="4.84">which is a surprisingly difficult task</text><text start="496.639" dur="5.321">if you have more charged batteries than</text><text start="498.68" dur="5.4">uncharged batteries then on average your</text><text start="501.96" dur="4.679">beam of light passing through will gain</text><text start="504.08" dur="5.079">energy the beam is Amplified but if you</text><text start="506.639" dur="4.28">have less than 50% charged batteries</text><text start="509.159" dur="3.68">then the the whole beam will eventually</text><text start="510.919" dur="3.841">get absorbed and reemitted in random</text><text start="512.839" dur="4.841">directions your laser beam won&amp;#39;t be</text><text start="514.76" dur="5.079">Amplified it&amp;#39;ll be attenuated now keep</text><text start="517.68" dur="5.839">in mind that in a real laser even if you</text><text start="519.839" dur="5.44">start with almost all charged batteries</text><text start="523.519" dur="3.801">that light passes through all those</text><text start="525.279" dur="3.601">batteries and then reflects back and</text><text start="527.32" dur="3.68">passes through them again when they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="528.88" dur="4.639">all going to be discharged so you need</text><text start="531" dur="4.56">some mechanism to
