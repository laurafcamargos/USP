dur="2.959">London which were just as much about</text><text start="127.479" dur="3.321">protecting William from the locals</text><text start="128.959" dur="3.321">within as defending against the Vikings</text><text start="130.8" dur="2.92">from without this started a</text><text start="132.28" dur="3.319">Thousand-Year long tradition whereby</text><text start="133.72" dur="3.84">monarchs

of</text><text start="148.2" dur="4.039">London and hopefully suck power and</text><text start="150.08" dur="4.239">wealth away from it this was the start</text><text start="152.239" dur="3.761">of the second London as the centuries</text><text start="154.319" dur="3.401">passed Westminster grew and merged with</text><text start="156" dur="3.48">nearby towns eventually surrounding the</text><text start="157.72" dur="3.519">wall in and still separate city of</text><text start="159.48" dur="3.44">London but people began to call the</text><text start="161.239" dur="3.201">whole Urban collection London and the</text><text start="162.92" dur="3.36">name became official when Parliament</text><text start="164.44" dur="4">joined the towns together under a single</text><text

is</text><text start="185.239" dur="3.521">unusual to say the least the city of</text><text start="187.159" dur="3.401">London also has a representative in</text><text start="188.76"
