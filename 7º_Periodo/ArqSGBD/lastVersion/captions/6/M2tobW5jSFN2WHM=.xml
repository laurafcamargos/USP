<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="0.03" dur="3.869">so I&amp;#39;m currently preparing when it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1.92" dur="3.839">undoubtedly the tastiest crop to the</text><text start="3.899" dur="3.9">butter bat video this one&amp;#39;s even sort of</text><text start="5.759" dur="5.071">flying saucer shape I&amp;#39;m about to film</text><text start="7.799" dur="4.201">the butter bot stop-motion short I guess</text><text start="10.83" dur="3.84">it&amp;#39;s only going to be like a minute and</text><text start="12" dur="5.13">a half long but I&amp;#39;ve got a lot of really</text><text start="14.67" dur="5.279">fun ways that I have planned to do shots</text><text start="17.13" dur="6.3">in there so this video on the GoPro is</text><text start="19.949" dur="16.681">going to sort of be a top 5 shot behind</text><text start="23.43" dur="14.67">the scenes of making that video when I</text><text start="36.63" dur="3.21">went to the store to pick up pancake</text><text start="38.1" dur="3.84">ingredients I took the butter bottle</text><text start="39.84" dur="4.469">with me and felt a little bit like Jimmy</text><text start="41.94" dur="3.99">McGill trying to film commercial I set</text><text start="44.309" dur="3.061">the butter bot in my carton pulled out</text><text start="45.93" dur="3.809">my camera in front of the butter aisle</text><text start="47.37" dur="4.95">but that&amp;#39;s the final scene so let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="49.739" dur="4.59">rewind to before the butter bot was</text><text start="52.32" dur="5.489">awoken into his existentially</text><text start="54.329" dur="5.941">unfulfilled life in the original scene</text><text start="57.809" dur="4.561">we want Rick building the butter bot on</text><text start="60.27" dur="3.779">the kitchen table possibly just to annoy</text><text start="62.37" dur="3.9">Jiri with the sparks but you know he</text><text start="64.049" dur="4.051">probably also wanted the butter so I</text><text start="66.27" dur="3.84">needed some sort of establishing shot</text><text start="68.1" dur="4.53">preferably involving some flying sparks</text><text start="70.11" dur="5.73">so I used a dremel and just dribbled the</text><text start="72.63" dur="5.4">end of a bolt to make some sparks and I</text><text start="75.84" dur="4.889">wanted the camera to be moving during</text><text start="78.03" dur="4.92">that time so use my time-lapse slide rig</text><text start="80.729" dur="6.151">to move the camera now it&amp;#39;s a time-lapse</text><text start="82.95" dur="6.3">ring so it normally takes like 60 or 70</text><text start="86.88" dur="4.26">minutes to move from end to end but I</text><text start="89.25" dur="3.72">was able to make it slide for men to end</text><text start="91.14" dur="4.11">in just a few seconds because I tied a</text><text start="92.97" dur="4.02">piece of paracord to the dolly and just</text><text start="95.25" dur="4.259">pulled on that rope with my off-camera</text><text start="96.99" dur="4.68">arm for the clip on the table where both</text><text start="99.509" dur="4.65">my hands are visible I actually drove</text><text start="101.67" dur="5.479">the camera dolly with my foot and that</text><text start="104.159" dur="2.99">ended up working all right</text><text start="107.729" dur="4.781">once the butter bot wakes up he needs to</text><text start="110.59" dur="3.66">move but he doesn&amp;#39;t have any motors in</text><text start="112.51" dur="3.96">it so this is really the beauty of</text><text start="114.25" dur="4.59">stop-motion animations because video is</text><text start="116.47" dur="4.8">nothing except a series of images played</text><text start="118.84" dur="5.4">back very quickly we can create video</text><text start="121.27" dur="5.01">albeit very slowly by recording a set of</text><text start="124.24" dur="4.499">images with very slight movements from</text><text start="126.28" dur="4.83">frame to frame so for every frame of the</text><text start="128.739" dur="5.161">butter box movement I repositioned by</text><text start="131.11" dur="4.68">hand then took a separate picture and I</text><text start="133.9" dur="5.76">had to keep doing this for a while</text><text start="135.79" dur="5.88">I was also interspersing live-action</text><text start="139.66" dur="3.87">video with the stop-motion when the</text><text start="141.67" dur="3.42">butter bot wakes up you can see that I</text><text start="143.53" dur="3.15">set the butter bot down and that</text><text start="145.09" dur="3.69">happened in real time it was actual</text><text start="146.68" dur="4.05">video and then the still frames take</text><text start="148.78" dur="4.14">over and the butter bot moves under</text><text start="150.73" dur="4.38">stop-motion animation and after that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="152.92" dur="4.38">done I start recording real video again</text><text start="155.11" dur="4.379">and I picked a butter bot up the key to</text><text start="157.3" dur="4.92">this working is that the tripod cannot</text><text start="159.489" dur="4.801">move between clips or between frames of</text><text start="162.22" dur="3.87">the stop-motion so to limit camera</text><text start="164.29" dur="4.949">movement I was using an extremely rigid</text><text start="166.09" dur="4.979">tripod and ball joint mount and all of</text><text start="169.239" dur="3.511">the steel frames are actually activated</text><text start="171.069" dur="2.67">with an external trigger so I didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="172.75" dur="3.329">have to touch the camera</text><text start="173.739" dur="4.381">touching the camera for every frame and</text><text start="176.079" dur="3.75">necessarily moving it a little bit what</text><text start="178.12" dur="3.63">if me the final video looked like it was</text><text start="179.829" dur="5.91">vibrating and that would obviously have</text><text start="181.75" dur="5.61">been a problem so that&amp;#39;s all good</text><text start="185.739" dur="3.271">but how do you film a clip where I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="187.36" dur="3.719">moving at the same time as the butter</text><text start="189.01" dur="4.11">pot I&amp;#39;ll give you a hint I wasn&amp;#39;t moving</text><text start="191.079" dur="4.321">really really slowly and dubbing in my</text><text start="193.12" dur="5.61">own voice later I actually recorded two</text><text start="195.4" dur="5.459">separate videos one stop-motion and the</text><text start="198.73" dur="4.349">other live-action without moving the</text><text start="200.859" dur="4.44">camera and then edit them together later</text><text start="203.079" dur="4.981">using pieces of the frame from each</text><text start="205.299" dur="5.041">video in this case the left half of the</text><text start="208.06" dur="4.44">frame is stop motion and the right half</text><text start="210.34" dur="4.23">of the frame is live-action you can go</text><text start="212.5" dur="4.22">in later and erase that scene with some</text><text start="214.57" dur="6.2">color grading and editing</text><text start="216.72" dur="6.15">I use a similar technique for the scene</text><text start="220.77" dur="4.23">where I cloned myself to be cheery and</text><text start="222.87" dur="3.87">Rick at the same time you can see here</text><text start="225" dur="3.54">the dividing line runs right through the</text><text start="226.74" dur="3.66">middle of the room where half of the</text><text start="228.54" dur="3.51">frame is from one clip and the other</text><text start="230.4" dur="3.9">half of the frame is from the other clip</text><text start="232.05" dur="3.84">they&amp;#39;re both live action videos they</text><text start="234.3" dur="4.02">were both taken without moving the</text><text start="235.89" dur="5.37">camera so you can just sort of combine</text><text start="238.32" dur="4.65">them and all of the background stuff</text><text start="241.26" dur="3.57">stays still the only thing that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="242.97" dur="4.56">different between those clips is me</text><text start="244.83" dur="4.26">because I was moving back forth in some</text><text start="247.53" dur="3.75">cases it&amp;#39;s harder to pull off this</text><text start="249.09" dur="3.75">compositing because elements move from</text><text start="251.28" dur="3.78">one side of the screen to the other in</text><text start="252.84" dur="4.2">the butter box most fulfilling moment</text><text start="255.06" dur="3.81">here he delivers the butter and then I</text><text start="257.04" dur="4.259">actually reach in front of him with the</text><text start="258.87" dur="4.11">knife so when I filmed this live-action</text><text start="261.299" dur="3.961">clip the butter bot was standing still</text><text start="262.98" dur="4.14">having already delivered the butter so</text><text start="265.26" dur="4.23">after the stop-motion clip is done</text><text start="267.12" dur="4.35">playing I actually extend the boundary</text><text start="269.49" dur="4.8">of that mask and suddenly the entire</text><text start="271.47" dur="4.86">image is live-action so the trick is</text><text start="274.29" dur="5.94">matching up the colors to make this</text><text start="276.33" dur="5.61">transition as seamless as possible once</text><text start="280.23" dur="4.47">all the seams are plugged you have a</text><text start="281.94" dur="5.1">nice video but no audio so I was using a</text><text start="284.7" dur="4.53">microphone inside my lab coat to record</text><text start="287.04" dur="4.68">my voice but the butter bot has no voice</text><text start="289.23" dur="5.43">no sounds and no ability to make noises</text><text start="291.72" dur="5.13">using the objects around it so all of</text><text start="294.66" dur="6.24">that and had to be added in</text><text start="296.85" dur="6.3">post-processing I created his voice with</text><text start="300.9" dur="4.11">an online text-to-speech generator then</text><text start="303.15" dur="4.019">I took the recording into audacity and</text><text start="305.01" dur="4.17">we added a little bit of echo change the</text><text start="307.169" dur="4.801">pitch and played with the equalizer in</text><text start="309.18" dur="4.799">order to match up the FFT of the</text><text start="311.97" dur="5.52">original butter bottom voice with this</text><text start="313.979" dur="5.65">recording as closely as I could</text><text start="317.49" dur="3.97">recording the background noises was</text><text start="319.629" dur="4.231">really great because I always think that</text><text start="321.46" dur="4.289">fully work looks really fascinating it</text><text start="323.86" dur="3.739">always looks like a lot of fun and for</text><text start="325.749" dur="4.44">this project I got to try it out so</text><text start="327.599" dur="5.44">spoiler alert it was actually a lot of</text><text start="330.189" dur="5.491">fun the butter BOTS motor noises are</text><text start="333.039" dur="4.68">mean grinding the gearbox from my time</text><text start="335.68" dur="3.959">lapse trig my first thought was use a</text><text start="337.719" dur="3.6">drill gearbox but I actually don&amp;#39;t have</text><text start="339.639" dur="3.631">one in the department right now for the</text><text start="341.319" dur="4.41">scene where the butter bob breaks upon</text><text start="343.27" dur="4.619">first trying to wake up presumably he</text><text start="345.729" dur="3.78">was grinding something mechanical inside</text><text start="347.889" dur="4.171">and that was causing the failure so I</text><text start="349.509" dur="4.291">added a clicking noise over top of the</text><text start="352.06" dur="3.359">regular motor noises and that was</text><text start="353.8" dur="4.41">actually a pen running down the</text><text start="355.419" dur="4.951">gooseneck of my GoPro mount so combining</text><text start="358.21" dur="4.709">the gearbox grinding noises and those</text><text start="360.37" dur="5.4">clicking noises who created all of the</text><text start="362.919" dur="4.77">audio for the motion of the butter bot</text><text start="365.77" dur="4.739">and actually human moving his limbs</text><text start="367.689" dur="5.31">around beyond that I needed two other</text><text start="370.509" dur="5.43">pieces of Foley I recorded the Jerry&amp;#39;s</text><text start="372.999" dur="5.67">game audio popping balloon noise and the</text><text start="375.939" dur="4.141">plate dragging across the table those</text><text start="378.669" dur="3.451">are both really literal because I</text><text start="380.08" dur="3.6">actually just played various themes and</text><text start="382.12" dur="3.479">recorded a balloon popping and I</text><text start="383.68" dur="4.709">actually did drag its laid across my</text><text start="385.599" dur="4.59">desk and record that audio once you</text><text start="388.389" dur="3.12">compile all these sounds together you</text><text start="390.189" dur="3.84">get a pretty complicated looking</text><text start="391.509" dur="5.37">timeline and result I needed four tracks</text><text start="394.029" dur="5.04">a Foley in order to properly give the</text><text start="396.879" dur="3.451">butter bot some audio but it&amp;#39;s worth it</text><text start="399.069" dur="3.15">because the final product is</text><text start="400.33" dur="3.989">dramatically improved with the addition</text><text start="402.219" dur="4.68">of some audio even if I&amp;#39;m not you know a</text><text start="404.319" dur="4.5">highly skilled Foley artist hey I made</text><text start="406.899" dur="4.85">you you want me to take you apart just</text><text start="408.819" dur="2.93">go get the butter please</text><text start="414.77"

had to be</text><text start="436.659" dur="3.871">completely pre-scripted there&amp;#39;s not a</text><text start="438.729" dur="4.351">lot of room for AD living during the</text><text start="440.53"

of the butter bot all the video</text><text start="453.22" dur="4.289">that I take is at 30fps that&amp;#39;s pretty</text><text start="455.409" dur="4.26">much a standard but the butter bot looks</text><text start="457.509" dur="4.761">notably jerkier because he&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="459.669" dur="4.891">moving in either 15 FPS or 10 FPS</text><text start="462.27"
