college</text><text start="4.589" dur="5.701">in general in my trouble with the</text><text start="7.02" dur="5.579">electoral college video from 2011 I was</text><text start="10.29" dur="4.62">wrong to use the city limits for that</text><text start="12.599" dur="4.861">part of the argument rather than the</text><text start="14.91" dur="4.14">more expansive metro area the lawyer is</text><text start="17.46" dur="3.659">nerd inside of me still wants to argue</text><text start="19.05" dur="3.63">technically correct on that one I used</text><text start="21.119" dur="4.32">the city boundaries because the metro</text><text start="22.68" dur="5.07">areas are often vague and absurdly large</text><text start="25.439" dur="4.531">the New York metro area is six thousand</text><text start="27.75" dur="4.95">seven hundred plus square miles over</text><text start="29.97" dur="5.37">four states and from where i partly grew</text><text start="32.7" dur="4.98">up it seemed that a lot of that area had</text><text start="35.34" dur="4.86">nothing to do with new york city proper</text><text start="37.68" dur="4.68">so at the time i disregarded the metro</text><text start="40.2" dur="4.379">boundaries but using the strict city</text><text start="42.36" dur="4.62">boundaries in that video was the wrong</text><text start="44.579" dur="4.681">decision in retrospect in addition to</text><text start="46.98" dur="5.64">being a bad argument to make it also</text><text start="49.26" dur="5.67">doesn&amp;#39;t address the concerns this map</text><text start="52.62" dur="4.47">express and this is correct</text><text start="54.93" dur="4.199">half the population does live in the</text><text start="57.09" dur="4.379">gray counties and more than that the map</text><text start="59.129" dur="4.5">gets at a fundamental division in the</text><text start="61.469" dur="4.951">united states and other countries that</text><text start="63.629" dur="4.861">leads partly to the politics we see the</text><text start="66.42" dur="4.47">difference between the rural and the</text><text start="68.49" dur="4.26">urban if trends continue a higher

the idea that the</text><text start="89.34" dur="5.19">electoral college ensures the president</text><text start="91.86" dur="4.799">is elected by the states it doesn&amp;#39;t a</text><text
