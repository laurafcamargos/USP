<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="5.46" dur="5.25">this is a really great question because</text><text start="7.47" dur="5.46">everyone wants to know how we might you</text><text start="10.71" dur="5.28">know improve regenerative outcomes and</text><text start="12.93" dur="4.59">human patience right and so one way that</text><text start="15.99" dur="3.06">you can really start to think about how</text><text start="17.52" dur="3.63">to do that is to ask the question what</text><text start="19.05" dur="4.38">are the genes that enable axolotls to</text><text start="21.15" dur="3.78">regenerate so well and if you have the</text><text start="23.43" dur="3.329">whole genome then you can consider all</text><text start="24.93" dur="3.3">the genes because you know you have the</text><text start="26.759" dur="2.971">identity of all the genes and so what we</text><text start="28.23" dur="3.779">can do is we can say what are the genes</text><text start="29.73" dur="4.05">that help X levels are necessary for X</text><text start="32.009" dur="4.291">levels to regenerate and then we can</text><text start="33.78" dur="4.98">compare those genes to the genes in the</text><text start="36.3" dur="3.809">human and we can say okay do humans have</text><text start="38.76" dur="3.599">these genes or do they not have these</text><text start="40.109" dur="4.261">sheets and for once the humans might not</text><text start="42.359" dur="5.07">have we can say what would happen if you</text><text start="44.37" dur="4.439">gave for instance a mammal that gene for</text><text start="47.429" dur="3.57">instance what would be the consequences</text><text start="48.809" dur="3.811">could you at some level improve</text><text start="50.999" dur="3.781">regeneration maybe even just a little</text><text start="52.62" dur="4.11">bit and then another thing you can do is</text><text start="54.78" dur="4.98">say okay what about for the genes that</text><text start="56.73" dur="5.309">both X levels and humans in mice all of</text><text start="59.76" dur="5.46">them have are they a hundred percent</text><text start="62.039" dur="5.311">identical you know do they make the</text><text start="65.22" dur="4.32">exact same protein or not and do all the</text><text start="67.35" dur="3.69">same cells make that kind of protein etc</text><text start="69.54" dur="3.149">so you can go in and actually compare</text><text start="71.04" dur="3.509">you know point by point to see exactly</text><text start="72.689" dur="3.57">how similar are different they are and</text><text start="74.549" dur="3.241">that will give you some clues about you</text><text start="76.259" dur="3.631">know where they might where they might</text><text start="77.79" dur="3.42">be different and if they&amp;#39;re important</text><text start="79.89" dur="4.11">for regeneration you could say well</text><text start="81.21" dur="4.32">maybe the human one is perhaps broken in</text><text start="84" dur="3.81">this spot right so that would be really</text><text start="85.53" dur="4.049">important it&amp;#39;s also really important</text><text start="87.81" dur="4.5">experimentally for us to be able to</text><text start="89.579" dur="4.741">assign function to particular genes the</text><text start="92.31" dur="4.44">gold standard in genetics is to remove</text><text start="94.32" dur="3.659">them so to delete the gene and then see</text><text start="96.75" dur="2.28">what the consequences on the thing</text><text start="97.979" dur="4.471">you&amp;#39;re studying so in this case</text><text start="99.03" dur="5.22">regeneration and with the technologies</text><text start="102.45" dur="3.87">that we have now so for instance CRISPR</text><text start="104.25" dur="3.479">editing technologies you can do that if</text><text start="106.32" dur="2.49">you know what gene you&amp;#39;re studying but</text><text start="107.729" dur="3.39">if you don&amp;#39;t know what all the other</text><text start="108.81" dur="4.47">genes are that the axolotl has you might</text><text start="111.119" dur="3.871">secretly be mucking with one of the</text><text start="113.28" dur="3.99">other ones or many of the other ones and</text><text start="114.99" dur="3.989">so having the whole genome allows us to</text><text start="117.27" dur="4.26">much better predict what might be the</text><text start="118.979" dur="5.46">accidental you know what we call off</text><text start="121.53" dur="4.17">target genes that we might also be</text><text start="124.439" dur="2.82">hitting so that we can be much more</text><text start="125.7" dur="2.97">specific about saying okay we are</text><text start="127.259" dur="3.03">studying this one particular gene and</text><text start="128.67" dur="2.97">this is its function rather than not</text><text start="130.289" dur="2.461">knowing that we&amp;#39;re really disrupting a</text><text start="131.64" dur="3.59">whole bunch of different ones at the</text><text start="132.75" dur="2.48">same
