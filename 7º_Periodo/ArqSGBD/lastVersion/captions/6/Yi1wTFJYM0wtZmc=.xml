we</text><text start="37.95" dur="4.019">could go extremely fast and go straight</text><text start="39.84" dur="4.32">towards the cup if we plot these out</text><text start="41.969" dur="4.141">with

technically</text><text start="126.89" dur="5.49">correct in this usage but colloquially</text><text start="129.44" dur="5.94">we refer to diagrams like this as phase</text><text start="132.38" dur="5.43">spaces they&amp;#39;re basically detailed maps</text><text start="135.38" dur="5.43">of possible outcomes that you can</text><text start="137.81" dur="5.55">achieve in terms of variables that you</text><text start="140.81" dur="5.64">actually have control over but let&amp;#39;s get</text><text start="143.36" dur="4.65">back to the Gulf so two days after the</text><text start="146.45" dur="4.65">work meeting with the gallium nitride</text><text start="148.01" dur="5.46">growth phase space diagram I was back at</text><text start="151.1" dur="4.71">home on vacation watching the end of the</text><text start="153.47" dur="4.38">US Open with my parents and my brain</text><text start="155.81" dur="4.56">still wired for work was trying to come</text><text start="157.85" dur="5.19">up with phase space maps of golf plus if</text><text start="160.37" dur="5.04">you hit enough putts and put enough</text><text start="163.04" dur="6.12">points on this chart is it possible to</text><text

start="178.04" dur="4.919">so being a bit of a MATLAB addict I</text><text start="180.739" dur="3.991">decided to let my CPU do the work and</text><text start="182.959" dur="4.621">wrote this program instead of launching</text><text start="184.73" dur="4.95">one ball at a time I can make it try ten</text><text start="187.58" dur="4.379">different angles or ten different speeds</text><text start="189.68" dur="4.77">or a grid of 100 or if I get really</text><text start="191.959" dur="4.111">ambitious a grid of a million golf balls</text><text start="194.45" dur="3.39">all putt with slightly different</text><text start="196.07" dur="3.18">starting speeds and angles</text><text start="197.84" dur="3.36">we can putt a ball with every</text><text start="199.25" dur="3.959">conceivable starting condition and</text><text start="201.2" dur="3.06">record where it goes it either lands in</text><text start="203.209" dur="3.241">the hole or it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="204.26" dur="4.65">every ball with a different initial</text><text start="206.45" dur="4.83">condition becomes a pixel in phase space</text><text start="208.91" dur="4.23">the white here means that it went in and</text><text start="211.28" dur="3.569">the black means that it missed right now</text><text start="213.14" dur="4.319">it&amp;#39;s just the straight line bullet shots</text><text start="214.849" dur="2.97">making it in so let&amp;#39;s fast forward a</text><text start="217.459" dur="2.431">little bit</text><text start="217.819" dur="5.191">so once the program starts putting more</text><text start="219.89" dur="5.31">slowly and we can see that now the angle</text><text start="223.01" dur="4.32">necessary to make the shot has changed</text><text start="225.2" dur="4.289">you have to aim up the hill a bit to get</text><text start="227.33" dur="4.53">it to break down into the hole this</text><text start="229.489" dur="4.951">might be an intuitive result but you can</text><text start="231.86" dur="4.83">see it really clearly in phase space so</text><text start="234.44" dur="4.59">if there are so many ways to putt a golf</text><text start="236.69" dur="4.56">ball into the hole why do most players</text><text start="239.03" dur="4.35">hang out in this area why don&amp;#39;t we see</text><text start="241.25" dur="5.01">any straight line bullet shots in real</text><text start="243.38" dur="5.219">games well in real life you can&amp;#39;t always</text><text start="246.26" dur="3.33">make the putt and not all misses are</text><text start="248.599" dur="3.36">created equal</text><text start="249.59" dur="4.83">consider this pixel it&amp;#39;s a Miss right</text><text start="251.959" dur="4.53">next to a hole in phase space but the</text><text start="254.42" dur="5.189">ball that made that black pixel is way</text><text start="256.489" dur="5.161">out here it&amp;#39;s a mile from the pin if you</text><text start="259.609" dur="4.471">look at this other black pixel in phase</text><text start="261.65" dur="5.01">space it&amp;#39;s also a Miss right next to a</text><text start="264.08" dur="4.53">hole but the ball that made this pixel</text><text start="266.66" dur="4.2">landed right next to the hole so this is</text><text start="268.61" dur="4.26">where you want to be when you miss so if</text><text start="270.86" dur="4.17">where the ball lands is so important</text><text start="272.87" dur="3.9">let&amp;#39;s repeat the experiment but this</text><text start="275.03" dur="3.72">time we&amp;#39;re going to keep track of the</text><text start="276.77" dur="4.98">distance between the ball at rest and</text><text start="278.75" dur="6.12">the pin for every ball that misses while</text><text start="281.75" dur="5.43">we&amp;#39;re at it let&amp;#39;s upgrade from 225 putts</text><text start="284.87" dur="4.74">to a million putts and get some higher</text><text start="287.18" dur="4.32">resolution in phase space that gives us</text><text start="289.61" dur="4.59">a new picture of phase space like this</text><text start="291.5" dur="4.95">where white is in the hole red is a Miss</text><text start="294.2" dur="4.41">that landed far from the hole and blue</text><text start="296.45" dur="4.65">is a Miss that landed very close to the</text><text start="298.61" dur="5.79">hole anytime you putt the ball you might</text><text start="301.1" dur="5.4">mess up this is one because it&amp;#39;s hard to</text><text start="304.4" dur="4.29">because in physics we always need to</text><text start="306.5" dur="4.65">account for uncertainty that means that</text><text start="308.69" dur="4.65">on any given putt while you&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="311.15" dur="4.32">hit the ball with a very specific speed</text><text start="313.34" dur="5.07">and a very specific angle basically</text><text start="315.47" dur="6">aiming for a particular spot in phase</text><text start="318.41" dur="5.28">space you may twist slightly and end up</text><text start="321.47" dur="4.68">over here or not swing quite hard enough</text><text start="323.69" dur="4.89">and end up slightly down this way the</text><text start="326.15" dur="3.84">shape and size of this uncertainty box</text><text start="328.58" dur="3.36">is going to vary Bay</text><text start="329.99" dur="4.47">on your swing style but for simplicity</text><text start="331.94" dur="3.96">let&amp;#39;s just say that it&amp;#39;s a rectangle so</text><text start="334.46" dur="3.24">you&amp;#39;ve got a little bit of random noise</text><text start="335.9" dur="4.47">added to your putt speed into your putt</text><text start="337.7" dur="5.01">angle with every hit with our</text><text start="340.37" dur="4.38">high-resolution picture of face space we</text><text start="342.71" dur="5.91">start to understand why bullet shots</text><text start="344.75" dur="6.15">aren&amp;#39;t a thing in real golf if you can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="348.62" dur="4.68">control speed but somehow have a perfect</text><text start="350.9" dur="5.49">line maybe you want to go for the bullet</text><text start="353.3" dur="5.25">shot but if like any real human you have</text><text start="356.39" dur="4.2">some uncertainty in both speed and</text><text start="358.55" dur="3.84">distance when you putt the ball then</text><text start="360.59" dur="3.53">aiming somewhere in between the brake</text><text start="362.39" dur="4.17">and the bullet is what you want to do</text><text start="364.12" dur="4.75">aiming for the perfect breaking shot</text><text start="366.56" dur="4.47">that would come to rest on the hole if</text><text start="368.87" dur="4.77">the hole didn&amp;#39;t exist is a good option</text><text start="371.03" dur="5.43">because if you miss you end up near the</text><text start="373.64" dur="4.53">hole that said acknowledging you&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="376.46" dur="4.08">this little rectangle of face space</text><text start="378.17" dur="4.47">representing your likely shot and you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="380.54" dur="4.77">only filling part of it with in the hole</text><text start="382.64" dur="4.02">you actually maximize your chance of</text><text start="385.31" dur="3.72">hitting the ball and if you aim just</text><text start="386.66" dur="5.25">past the hole hit it a little bit harder</text><text start="389.03" dur="5.52">you want to maximize the white in the</text><text start="391.91" dur="4.44">hole area inside the little rectangle of</text><text start="394.55" dur="5.67">phase space that you are likely to</text><text start="396.35" dur="5.07">sample when you putt the ball the other</text><text start="400.22" dur="4.41">thing I thought was really interesting</text><text start="401.42" dur="4.83">was the idea of a dead zone if you want</text><text start="404.63" dur="3.72">to get the ball to stop on the other</text><text start="406.25" dur="4.32">side of this hill for example it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="408.35" dur="4.41">physically impossible because if you hit</text><text start="410.57" dur="3.87">the ball too softly it doesn&amp;#39;t make it</text><text start="412.76" dur="4.35">over the hill but if you hit the ball</text><text start="414.44" dur="4.98">just slightly harder it gains energy</text><text start="417.11" dur="4.53">falling down the hill and can&amp;#39;t possibly</text><text start="419.42" dur="5.19">stop until it&amp;#39;s way past it</text><text start="421.64" dur="5.34">this entire slope is an unreachable area</text><text start="424.61" dur="4.59">a dead zone turns out this problem is</text><text start="426.98" dur="4.74">especially bad on the super fast greens</text><text start="429.2" dur="4.35">at Pinehurst that I can simulate pretty</text><text start="431.72" dur="5.01">easily by changing a single variable</text><text start="433.55" dur="5.13">that is effectively green speed if we</text><text start="436.73" dur="4.71">want to simulate this dead zone let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="438.68" dur="4.86">make a big hill and when we put 10,000</text><text start="441.44" dur="3.93">golf balls at it at once we see that</text><text start="443.54" dur="4.38">they avoid this spot like the plague</text><text start="445.37" dur="4.77">some go part way up the hill some have</text><text start="447.92" dur="5.07">exactly the perfect speed to get stuck</text><text start="450.14" dur="5.19">on the top of the hill and all of the</text><text start="452.99" dur="4.65">balls that make it over the top keep</text><text start="455.33" dur="4.92">going until they exit the simulation at</text><text start="457.64" dur="4.8">the far edge they just can&amp;#39;t stop back</text><text start="460.25" dur="2.9">here no matter what they do at the risk</text><text start="462.44" dur="2.75">of this sound</text><text start="463.15" dur="3.54">like a numberphile video that got me</text><text start="465.19" dur="3.33">curious to know whether there were any</text><text start="466.69" dur="4.65">locations on the green that you</text><text start="468.52" dur="4.89">physically couldn&amp;#39;t reach in the hill</text><text start="471.34" dur="4.74">example why you couldn&amp;#39;t get the ball to</text><text start="473.41" dur="4.38">stop in the dead zone if you put the cup</text><text start="476.08" dur="3.51">in the dead zone a ball could have</text><text start="477.79" dur="4.5">landed in it as it rolled through</text><text start="479.59" dur="5.19">interestingly enough that puts the hole</text><text start="482.29" dur="4.59">in phase space in the middle of a pocket</text><text start="484.78" dur="5.64">of red because it&amp;#39;s impossible to miss</text><text start="486.88" dur="6.6">the cup and stop near the hole within my</text><text start="490.42" dur="4.8">admittedly limited simulation I could</text><text start="493.48" dur="3.66">not come up with any geometries that</text><text start="495.22" dur="4.44">completely prohibited you from making</text><text start="497.14" dur="4.89">the shop provided that you could putt</text><text start="499.66" dur="4.11">the ball in an obscenely high speed and</text><text start="502.03" dur="3.72">go straight towards the hole if you</text><text start="503.77" dur="4.52">limited the speed you could probably</text><text start="505.75" dur="4.86">come up with some forbidden geometries</text><text start="508.29" dur="5.83">also shooting the ball like a bullet</text><text start="510.61" dur="5.13">straight towards the hole is easy to</text><text start="514.12" dur="4.35">simulate if you imagine that everything</text><text start="515.74" dur="4.17">that touches of the hole goes in but in</text><text start="518.47" dur="4.05">real life you&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re gonna skip over</text><text start="519.91" dur="4.29">the hole or with as fast as I was having</text><text start="522.52" dur="3.96">to simulate it I don&amp;#39;t know break right</text><text start="524.2" dur="4.38">through the pin and just keep on going</text><text start="526.48" dur="4.59">so these are the things that I didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="528.58" dur="4.92">bother to try to simulate that said I</text><text start="531.07" dur="4.04">was able to come up with the green in</text><text start="533.5" dur="4.26">this simulation that has a</text><text start="535.11" dur="5.5">one-dimensional solution if you make the</text><text start="537.76" dur="4.2">green a pyramid and you put the ball at</text><text start="540.61" dur="3.54">one of the bottom corners of that</text><text start="541.96" dur="4.74">pyramid it&amp;#39;s possible for the computer</text><text start="544.15" dur="5.88">to putt the ball up to the corner of the</text><text

wouldn&amp;#39;t land on one side</text><text start="554.56" dur="3.89">or the other and never make it to the</text><text start="556.15" dur="5.22">cup the phase space for this green is</text><text

phase spaces look really</text><text start="583.96" dur="4.59">weird in fact this one when I simulated</text><text start="586.48" dur="5.22">it and you know if did the million golf</text><text start="588.55" dur="6.4">ball phase space actually has a hook in</text><text start="591.7" dur="5.86">it at one ball speed there</text><text start="594.95" dur="4.2">two different angles that you can

like this is that once you</text><text start="641.33" dur="3.69">have the code written you can just throw</text><text start="643.13" dur="4.32">all kinds of random nonsense into it</text><text start="645.02" dur="4.14">here I&amp;#39;ve decreased the friction to zero</text><text start="647.45" dur="4.17">and made all the balls really heavy so</text><text start="649.16" dur="5.43">they orbit the pit like a solar system</text><text start="651.62" dur="4.86">demo this is a bunch of spikes that the</text><text start="654.59" dur="4.56">balls have to try to weave between on</text><text start="656.48" dur="4.77">their way to the hole and this is an</text><text start="659.15" dur="4.23">inverted pyramid with the hole at the</text><text start="661.25" dur="3.87">bottom if we throw a million golf balls</text><text start="663.38" dur="4.14">into it they kind of slosh around for a</text><text start="665.12" dur="5.25">while before some finally stopped and</text><text start="667.52" dur="5.1">some finally go in all that sloshing</text><text start="670.37" dur="4.89">draws these really bizarre really</text><text start="672.62" dur="4.62">complicated swirls in phase space that I</text><text start="675.26" dur="4.05">think look really cool are you ever</text><text start="677.24" dur="3.63">gonna see a green like this in real life</text><text start="679.31" dur="2.55">and have to contemplate this shot</text><text start="680.87" dur="2.88">probably not</text><text start="681.86" dur="3.75">anyways I was amused by this for a few</text><text start="683.75" dur="3.63">days and I don&amp;#39;t know if thinking in</text><text start="685.61" dur="3.36">phase space is actually going to help</text><text start="687.38" dur="2.28">your game or not but hopefully you

about this particular spot</text><text start="750.56" dur="4.26">plotted against all these variables</text><text start="752.36" dur="4.8">there are also a whole lot more knobs to</text><text start="754.82" dur="4.83">turn imagine how much more complicated</text><text start="757.16" dur="4.83">this gets when we go from two variables</text><text start="759.65" dur="5.82">to control to three
