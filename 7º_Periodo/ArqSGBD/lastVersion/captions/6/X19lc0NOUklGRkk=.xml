dur="5.16">quintessential maker material 3D printed</text><text start="93.32" dur="4">pla I&amp;#39;ve been learning a lot about 3D</text><text start="95.72" dur="3.2">printing as a result of the steampunk</text><text start="97.32" dur="4">glasses project so this was</text><text start="98.92" dur="4.28">comparatively very easy I started with</text><text start="101.32" dur="3.839">the official Vector file of the YouTube</text><text start="103.2" dur="3.199">logo that I got off the YouTube website</text><text start="105.159" dur="3.28">simplified it a little bit in</text><text start="106.399" dur="5.481">illustrator and then imported it as a</text><text start="108.439" dur="5.481">sketch to Fusion 360 to make a 3D model</text><text start="111.88" dur="3.599">I extruded the button border and then</text><text start="113.92" dur="3.199">added a bunch of bevels to round off the</text><text start="115.479" dur="3.32">shape although I&amp;#39;m frustrated I couldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="117.119" dur="4.201">figure out how to do a sweep cut on a</text><text start="118.799" dur="4.441">non-circular path I got something that</text><text start="121.32" dur="4.2">uh I ended up liking a lot so after</text><text start="123.24" dur="4.12">getting this rounded shape I opened the</text><text start="125.52" dur="4.04">original sketch again rounded off the</text><text start="127.36" dur="4.2">corners of the triangle and then cut the</text><text start="129.56" dur="4.12">Triangular play symbol into the top of</text><text start="131.56" dur="2.12">the</text><text start="143.92" dur="4.52">button I printed the button on the momax</text><text start="146.48" dur="4.479">printer at the Santa Barbara hacker bace</text><text start="148.44" dur="4.12">I used a .15 m layer thickness and</text><text start="150.959" dur="4.441">printed straight on the bed with no</text><text start="152.56" dur="2.84">extra adhesion</text><text start="156.44" dur="3.56">promoter the button came out looking</text><text start="158.48" dur="3.28">like this and I sanded the surface</text><text start="160" dur="3.8">heavily to smooth out The Ridges left by</text><text start="161.76" dur="3.6">the printing I&amp;#39;m slightly disappointed</text><text start="163.8" dur="3.439">that lines are faintly visible on the</text><text start="165.36" dur="3.64">model but my sandpaper wasn&amp;#39;t quite</text><text start="167.239" dur="4.121">gritty enough to completely smooth the</text><text start="169" dur="3.959">part in a reasonable time I also had a</text><text start="171.36" dur="4.159">grid of weird bumps that showed up on</text><text start="172.959" dur="4.481">the top surface that I realized are</text><text start="175.519" dur="3.921">actually pretty fascinating when the top</text><text start="177.44" dur="4.2">layer of plastic covers the waffle</text><text start="179.44" dur="4.519">looking infill it creates an airtight</text><text start="181.64" dur="4.28">seal with hot plastic and the plastic</text><text start="183.959" dur="4.28">heats up the air trapped inside the</text><text start="185.92" dur="4.239">little waffled pore which expands and</text><text start="188.239" dur="4.041">pushes out on the fresh plastic layer</text><text start="190.159" dur="4.44">which is still hot and pliable making</text><text start="192.28" dur="4">visible bumps on the part so this was</text><text start="194.599" dur="3.481">sort of a weird thing that happened but</text><text start="196.28" dur="3.56">I was able to sand off the bumps on the</text><text start="198.08" dur="3.96">outside of the button which was good</text><text start="199.84" dur="4.6">unfortunately because the uh recess</text><text start="202.04" dur="4.72">triangle was very hard to sand those</text><text start="204.44" dur="4.92">bumps are still</text><text start="206.76" dur="5.199">visible after sanding I primed and</text><text start="209.36" dur="6.28">painted the part a bright glossy red to</text><text start="211.959" dur="3.681">match the classic YouTube button</text><text start="218.799" dur="6.8">color well it&amp;#39;s uh it&amp;#39;s sprayed all</text><text start="221.519" dur="4.08">shiny and red looks like a real play</text><text start="225.61" dur="4.66">[Music]</text><text start="234.56" dur="4.44">button I used a laser cutter to etch and</text><text start="237.36" dur="3.68">cut the back plate for the button</text><text start="239" dur="3.799">unfortunately I mistakenly typed in my</text><text start="241.04" dur="2.96">Vector settings for leather so it didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="242.799" dur="3.52">actually cut all the way through the</text><text start="244" dur="4.319">quarter inch plywood however there was a</text><text start="246.319" dur="3.881">dark score Mark left over that I could</text><text start="248.319" dur="3.721">like cut up to I could use as a marking</text><text start="250.2" dur="4.319">line and I had to finish cutting it out</text><text start="252.04" dur="5.24">with the band saw then I actually sanded</text><text start="254.519" dur="4.44">up to that edge line with a Disc Sander</text><text start="257.28" dur="3.239">which was actually pretty fun because I</text><text start="258.959" dur="3.081">hadn&amp;#39;t used a Disc Sander since high</text><text start="260.519" dur="4.321">school wood shop like seven or eight</text><text start="262.04" dur="4.92">years ago once I had the board sanded up</text><text start="264.84" dur="4.72">to the line I applied a coat and a half</text><text start="266.96" dur="4.12">sort of of polyurethane just to seal up</text><text start="269.56" dur="4.12">the the surface so that I could like</text><text start="271.08" dur="4.6">weather paint the etched Parts where you</text><text start="273.68" dur="3.6">uh paint the uh letters and the logo</text><text start="275.68" dur="3.64">shapes black and then wipe up all the</text><text start="277.28" dur="4.759">extra paint over the top so that the</text><text start="279.32" dur="4.92">paint only stays in the recessed regions</text><text start="282.039" dur="4.121">after that paint dried I lightly sanded</text><text start="284.24" dur="3.28">the surface to smooth it out and to take</text><text start="286.16" dur="3.879">up a bit of the black paint that got</text><text start="287.52" dur="4.72">stuck on the outside and then one more</text><text start="290.039" dur="4.121">thick spray coat of polyurethane and the</text><text start="292.24" dur="3.399">back plate was complete of course the</text><text start="294.16" dur="5.52">last step is just to glue down the</text><text start="295.639" dur="4.041">button and then it&amp;#39;s done</text><text start="300.82" dur="20.46">[Music]</text><text start="318.28" dur="4.84">so now that I have my uh two to the 10</text><text start="321.28"
