dur="5.039">have looked like Luca was not the origin</text><text start="66.76" dur="5.12">of life on Earth but the emergence of</text><text start="68.799" dur="5.201">Life as we know it today and Luca was</text><text start="71.88" dur="4.08">not alone we can think of Luca as more</text><text start="74" dur="4">like a population rather than like a</text><text start="75.96" dur="3.68">single uh individual and there probably</text><text start="78" dur="3.72">were many different types of organisms</text><text start="79.64" dur="4.159">living at that time whose descendants</text><text start="81.72" dur="4.84">later died out fairly shortly thereafter</text><text start="83.799" dur="5.32">or maybe died out only recently but Luca</text><text start="86.56" dur="3.919">survived and went

dur="4.279">our evolutionary history history Edmund</text><text start="120.799" dur="4.441">Moody Phil Donahue and their team sought</text><text start="123.159" dur="4.32">to reconstruct Lucas&amp;#39;s genome or</text><text start="125.24" dur="3.92">collection of genes and then from these</text><text start="127.479" dur="3.84">try and build kind of like a working</text><text start="129.16" dur="4.68">metabolic Network and then use this as a</text><text start="131.319" dur="4.121">basis to try and understand what Luca</text><text start="133.84" dur="3.44">would have been like their approach</text><text start="135.44" dur="3.72">involved filling out an evolutionary</text><text start="137.28" dur="4.72">family tree based on the genomic</text><text start="139.16" dur="5.2">relationships among 700 living bacterial</text><text start="142" dur="5.519">and Aran species what we need to do is</text><text start="144.36" dur="5.239">infer a tree of those 700 species those</text><text start="147.519" dur="4.281">700 genomes in order to do that you need</text><text start="149.599" dur="4.92">to pull out genes which we think have</text><text start="151.8" dur="4.56">evolved very slowly been very conserved</text><text start="154.519" dur="4.64">haven&amp;#39;t changed much over the billions</text><text start="156.36" dur="4.76">of years using a suite of software and</text><text start="159.159" dur="4.041">loads of computing power the team</text><text start="161.12" dur="4.479">constructed a probabilistic genan tree</text><text start="163.2" dur="4.92">leading back to Luca so this says okay</text><text start="165.599" dur="6">well we&amp;#39;ve got X number of genes a</text><text start="168.12" dur="5.119">probability of 50% or probability of 75%</text><text start="171.599" dur="4.64">um therefore we think that these genes</text><text start="173.239" dur="4.72">were probably in Luca by integrating the</text><text start="176.239" dur="4.28">probabilities of thousands of Gene</text><text start="177.959" dur="5.881">families the team estimated Lucas genome</text><text start="180.519" dur="5.8">likely encoded 2600 proteins our main</text><text start="183.84" dur="4.84">take-home result is that Luca is is is a</text><text start="186.319" dur="4.64">complex organism very similar perhaps a</text><text start="188.68" dur="4.6">bit smaller than a a modern day</text><text start="190.959" dur="5.2">bacterium for example Luca would have</text><text start="193.28" dur="4.959">had a simple phospholipid membrane and</text><text start="196.159" dur="5.321">the molecular machinery for maintaining</text><text start="198.239" dur="5.56">a genome and building proteins it could</text><text start="201.48" dur="3.88">metabolize hydrogen gas and carbon</text><text start="203.799" dur="2.881">dioxide but one of the really</text><text start="205.36" dur="3.239">interesting things that we found which</text><text start="206.68" dur="4.199">was a complete surprise to us was this</text><text start="208.599" dur="4.521">criser cast system crisper Cass is a</text><text start="210.879" dur="4.401">basic immune system cells used to fight</text><text start="213.12" dur="3.72">off viral attacks then some people are</text><text start="215.28" dur="4.2">surprised that viruses would have been</text><text start="216.84" dur="4.52">around that long ago Luca may have lived</text><text start="219.48" dur="4.8">off of non-living sources like</text><text start="221.36" dur="4.72">hydrothermal vents or atmospheric gases</text><text start="224.28" dur="4.239">or it may have dined on the chemical</text><text start="226.08" dur="3.4">waste of other microbes to me it seems</text><text start="228.519" dur="3.121">more likely that luk would have been</text><text start="229.48" dur="4.44">part of a a complex ecosystem even at</text><text start="231.64" dur="3.92">that point in time exchanging metabolic</text><text start="233.92" dur="3.679">products Etc with with all sorts of</text><text start="235.56" dur="4.2">different things for a complete picture</text><text start="237.599" dur="5.441">the team also needed to determine when</text><text start="239.76" dur="6.399">Luca lived and so we used uh some</text><text start="243.04" dur="6.52">molecular and paleontological methods to</text><text start="246.159" dur="6.201">try to estimate its age by calibrating</text><text start="249.56" dur="4.759">the branches within genome trees by</text><text start="252.36" dur="4.48">comparing the rates of mutation over</text><text start="254.319" dur="5.04">time across Gene families they were able</text><text start="256.84" dur="5.119">to arrive at a date so we estimated</text><text start="259.359" dur="5.12">Luca&amp;#39;s age to be around 4.2 billion</text><text start="261.959" dur="4.24">years old this is fairly soon after the</text><text start="264.479" dur="4.881">Earth would have cooled off and been</text><text start="266.199" dur="5.521">habitable for life to emerge to me that</text><text start="269.36" dur="5.119">really ancient age is very surprising</text><text start="271.72" dur="5.16">because we reconstruct lucer as being</text><text start="274.479" dur="5.641">quite a complex organism and yet it</text><text start="276.88" dur="6.92">existed within about 2 3 400 million</text><text start="280.12" dur="5.88">years of Earth forming as a planet</text><text start="283.8" dur="4.56">hopefully
