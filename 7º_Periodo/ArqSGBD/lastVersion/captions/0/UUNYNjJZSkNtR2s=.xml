we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="4.12" dur="3.88">about to shine some white light into it</text><text start="6.52" dur="4.52">but before it gets there it passes</text><text start="8" dur="5.08">through a linearly polarizing filter and</text><text start="11.04" dur="3.839">what that means basically is that if you</text><text start="13.08" dur="3.92">look at all of the light waves beyond</text><text start="14.879" dur="3.681">the point of that filter those waves are</text><text start="17" dur="4.279">only going to be wiggling in One</text><text start="18.56" dur="4.16">Direction say up and down and don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="21.279" dur="3.32">worry in a few minutes we&amp;#39;re going to go</text><text start="22.72" dur="3.719">into much more detail about what</text><text start="24.599" dur="3.641">specifically is wiggling and what the</text><text start="26.439" dur="4.16">significance of that wiggling direction</text><text start="28.24" dur="4.68">is but skipping to the punch line first</text><text start="30.599" dur="4.001">the demo also includes a second linearly</text><text start="32.92" dur="3.72">polarizing filter coming out the other</text><text start="34.6" dur="4.32">end and I want you to predict what we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="36.64" dur="4.2">going to see once we turn the light on</text><text start="38.92" dur="3.4">now I suspect some viewers might already</text><text start="40.84" dur="3.719">have a little bit of a sense for what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="42.32" dur="4.559">going on because a few years ago Steve</text><text start="44.559" dur="4.201">mold made a really excellent video about</text><text start="46.879" dur="3.921">this phenomenon of shining polarized</text><text start="48.76" dur="3.959">light through sugar water it was really</text><text start="50.8" dur="4.04">well done which is no surprise because</text><text start="52.719" dur="4.081">everything Steve makes is but even if</text><text start="54.84" dur="3.559">you watched that this is a rich enough</text><text start="56.8" dur="4.04">phenomenon that there&amp;#39;s still more to be</text><text start="58.399" dur="4.521">explained in fact even if you made that</text><text start="60.84" dur="4.08">video this is a rich enough phenomenon</text><text start="62.92" dur="4.08">that there&amp;#39;s more to be explained I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="64.92" dur="3.879">curious Steve when you made that video</text><text start="67" dur="4">did you happen to get a good view of the</text><text start="68.799" dur="3.561">side of the glass probably when the rest</text><text start="71" dur="5.04">of the lights in the room were off or</text><text start="72.36" dur="6.56">something like that no no I didn&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="76.04" dur="4.92">about the side view great so given the</text><text start="78.92" dur="3.8">setup that we&amp;#39;re looking at now once we</text><text start="80.96" dur="3.6">turn off the room lights and turn on the</text><text start="82.72" dur="4.52">lamp I&amp;#39;m curious if you have a</text><text start="84.56" dur="6.08">prediction for what you might see well</text><text start="87.24" dur="4.68">there will be some scattering I suppose</text><text start="90.64" dur="4.839">but then if we&amp;#39;re just looking at the</text><text start="91.92" dur="5.199">tube we&amp;#39;re not applying any kind of uh</text><text start="95.479" dur="5">filter to just looking directly at the</text><text start="97.119" dur="5.36">tube so I mean my my instinct is nothing</text><text start="100.479" dur="4.041">nothing will happen that would have been</text><text start="102.479" dur="3.28">my guess too but let me just show you</text><text start="104.52" dur="4.72">what it looks like when we turn off the</text><text start="105.759" dur="5.201">room lights and we turn on the lamp ooh</text><text start="109.24" dur="3.919">and then if you uh turn the initial</text><text start="110.96" dur="4.119">polarizer you can kind of see those</text><text start="113.159" dur="4.201">stripes those diagonal Stripes seem to</text><text start="115.079" dur="5.601">walk up the tube oh</text><text start="117.36" dur="5.719">wow but why diagonal exactly why</text><text start="120.68" dur="5.16">diagonal but why anything I mean why</text><text start="123.079" dur="4.921">anything yeah something about the</text><text start="125.84" dur="4.16">interaction with sugar water separates</text><text start="128" dur="4.64">the light out into these different bands</text><text start="130" dur="4.8">of color but it does so in this really</text><text start="132.64" dur="5.8">intriguing way where the colors appear</text><text start="134.8" dur="5.96">to form these spiral helixes down the</text><text start="138.44" dur="4.4">tube and the other thing I want to draw</text><text start="140.76" dur="4.119">your attention to is the color that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="142.84" dur="4.8">coming out of the tube after it passes</text><text start="144.879" dur="4.64">through that second filter as we rotate</text><text start="147.64" dur="4.76">the first filter you rotate through a</text><text start="149.519" dur="4.321">fan family of distinct Hues and it</text><text start="152.4" dur="3.479">doesn&amp;#39;t have to be the first filter if</text><text start="153.84" dur="3.96">you rotate that second filter you also</text><text start="155.879" dur="4.28">rotate through these various different</text><text start="157.8" dur="5">colors that&amp;#39;s Quinn by the way who</text><text start="160.159" dur="4.321">kindly set up this whole demo and what I</text><text start="162.8" dur="3.359">love about this setup is that if you</text><text start="164.48" dur="4.039">want to really understand what you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="166.159" dur="4.72">looking at with that deep to your bones</text><text start="168.519" dur="4.561">satisfying sense of what&amp;#39;s going on it</text><text start="170.879" dur="3.801">requires having very solid intuitions</text><text start="173.08" dur="4.4">for a number of different fundamental</text><text start="174.68" dur="5.24">concepts about light like polarization</text><text start="177.48" dur="5.08">how scattering works and how an index of</text><text start="179.92" dur="4.56">refraction Works to kick things off let</text><text start="182.56" dur="4.08">me show you the overall structure for</text><text start="184.48" dur="3.8">the explanation of what&amp;#39;s going on here</text><text start="186.64" dur="4.44">and along the way record various</text><text start="188.28" dur="4.4">questions that we still need to answer a</text><text start="191.08" dur="3.76">basic premise to the whole thing is to</text><text start="192.68" dur="4.199">think about polarized light as a</text><text start="194.84" dur="4.119">propagating wave which is wiggling in</text><text start="196.879" dur="3.761">Just One Direction and I suppose</text><text start="198.959" dur="4.321">question number zero is for us to be</text><text start="200.64" dur="4.159">clear about what exactly is wiggling</text><text start="203.28" dur="2.879">postponing that for the moment we&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="204.799" dur="3.52">just say if we think about it as</text><text start="206.159" dur="4.44">propagating in One Direction say along</text><text start="208.319" dur="4.48">an xais the wiggling happens</text><text start="210.599" dur="4.441">perpendicular to that say in the Z</text><text start="212.799" dur="4.281">Direction what&amp;#39;s going on when it passes</text><text start="215.04" dur="4.839">through this tube of sugar water is that</text><text start="217.08" dur="5.48">that wiggling Direction gets twisted and</text><text start="219.879" dur="4.161">so the first key question is why what is</text><text start="222.56" dur="3.72">it about interaction with sugar that</text><text start="224.04" dur="4.52">causes this twist and just so that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="226.28" dur="4">Crystal Clear what I mean by twisting if</text><text start="228.56" dur="3.759">you focus your attention on a single</text><text start="230.28" dur="4.599">slice perpendicular to the axis of the</text><text start="232.319" dur="4.84">cylinder and draw a line indicating how</text><text start="234.879" dur="4.36">the light is wiggling on that slice then</text><text start="237.159" dur="4.64">if you were to move that slice down the</text><text start="239.239" dur="5.481">cylinder the relevant wiggling Direction</text><text start="241.799" dur="5.52">slowly turns about the axis of the</text><text start="244.72" dur="4.719">cylinder critically the rate at which</text><text start="247.319" dur="4.681">it&amp;#39;s getting twisted depends on the</text><text start="249.439" dur="5.201">frequency of the light higher frequency</text><text start="252" dur="4.68">light say violet actually gets twisted</text><text start="254.64" dur="4.719">more quickly than low frequency light</text><text start="256.68" dur="5">like red so the second key question we</text><text start="259.359" dur="4.801">need to answer is why would that</text><text start="261.68" dur="4.32">twisting rate depend on the frequency</text><text start="264.16" dur="3.96">whatever explanation we come to for why</text><text start="266" dur="4.16">the twisting happens in the first place</text><text start="268.12" dur="4.56">it should offer some intuition for where</text><text start="270.16" dur="4.759">the dependence on frequency would come</text><text start="272.68" dur="4.2">from let&amp;#39;s take a moment to think about</text><text start="274.919" dur="3.56">what it means that different colors of</text><text start="276.88" dur="4.12">light are getting twisted at different</text><text start="278.479" dur="4.681">rates in the demo we&amp;#39;re shining in white</text><text start="281" dur="3.88">light and white light is not a clean</text><text start="283.16" dur="3.4">pure sine wave it&amp;#39;s something more</text><text start="284.88" dur="3.56">complicated and you typically think</text><text start="286.56" dur="3.8">about it as a combination of many</text><text start="288.44" dur="3.52">different pure sine waves each one</text><text start="290.36" dur="4.2">corresponding to one of the colors in</text><text start="291.96" dur="4.36">the rainbow for this animation I will</text><text start="294.56" dur="4.079">schematically represent the wiggling</text><text start="296.32" dur="3.879">direction for each pure frequency just</text><text start="298.639" dur="3.761">with a line</text><text start="300.199" dur="4.681">so the key idea is that as all of those</text><text start="302.4" dur="4.519">different waves propagate down the tube</text><text start="304.88" dur="4.28">with different pure frequencies twisting</text><text start="306.919" dur="3.961">at different rates purple light twisting</text><text start="309.16" dur="4.52">the fastest and red light twisting the</text><text start="310.88" dur="5.039">slowest then the polarization directions</text><text start="313.68" dur="4.4">for each one of those pure colors get</text><text start="315.919" dur="3.961">separated out for example by the time</text><text start="318.08" dur="3.559">you reach the end of the tube they all</text><text start="319.88" dur="3.4">have their own distinct wiggling</text><text start="321.639" dur="3.68">directions but one thing that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="323.28" dur="4.199">important to understand is that this is</text><text start="325.319" dur="3.641">still white light if you were to put</text><text start="327.479" dur="3.241">your eye at the end of the tube and look</text><text start="328.96" dur="4.04">towards the lamp it wouldn&amp;#39;t look</text><text start="330.72" dur="4">colored in any way because even if the</text><text start="333" dur="3.44">wiggling directions are all different</text><text start="334.72" dur="4.039">they&amp;#39;s still the same amount of each</text><text start="336.44" dur="4.72">color as there was at the start in order</text><text start="338.759" dur="4.361">to see any evidence of this separation</text><text start="341.16" dur="3.879">one thing you could do is pass it all</text><text start="343.12" dur="4.88">through a second linear polarizing</text><text start="345.039" dur="5.361">filter say in the vertical Direction the</text><text start="348" dur="4.12">effect that has is that the amount of</text><text start="350.4" dur="4.68">light of a given frequency passing</text><text start="352.12" dur="5.079">through is equal to the component of its</text><text start="355.08" dur="4.559">polarization direction that lines up</text><text start="357.199" dur="4">with the filter so colors which have</text><text start="359.639" dur="4.041">happen to align very closely with that</text><text start="361.199" dur="3.881">filter pass through almost completely</text><text start="363.68" dur="3.639">whereas colors which end up more</text><text start="365.08" dur="4.44">perpendicular to the filter pass through</text><text start="367.319" dur="4.521">only very</text><text start="369.52" dur="4.56">weakly so the light coming out the other</text><text start="371.84" dur="3.759">end of this filter is some imbalanced</text><text start="374.08" dur="3.48">combination of all of the pure</text><text start="375.599" dur="3.72">frequencies which is why what we see</text><text start="377.56" dur="5.12">coming out the other end is no longer</text><text start="379.319" dur="5.041">white but some other color and notice if</text><text start="382.68" dur="4.079">we rotate the whole setup Say by</text><text start="384.36" dur="4.399">twisting the initial polarizing filter</text><text start="386.759" dur="4.72">then that changes the components of each</text><text start="388.759" dur="4.601">PR frequency that happen to be vertical</text><text start="391.479" dur="4.361">resulting in a different balance of all</text><text start="393.36" dur="4.72">those colors which is why rotating the</text><text start="395.84" dur="4.359">initial filter changes the color you see</text><text start="398.08" dur="3.44">coming out the other end and this is</text><text start="400.199" dur="3.321">something you can do at home by the way</text><text start="401.52" dur="3.6">you don&amp;#39;t need a very fancy setup start</text><text start="403.52" dur="3.28">by creating a pretty dense mixture of</text><text start="405.12" dur="3.68">sugar water and then you&amp;#39;ll need to get</text><text start="406.8" dur="3.72">your hands on some polarizing filters so</text><text start="408.8" dur="3.48">that you can pass light first through</text><text start="410.52" dur="3.72">one of those filters then through the</text><text start="412.28" dur="3.639">sugar water and then through a second</text><text start="414.24" dur="4.04">filter and if you look at this whole</text><text start="415.919" dur="4.881">setup from the top as you rotate one of</text><text start="418.28" dur="5.4">those filters you&amp;#39;ll see different</text><text start="420.8" dur="4.44">colors but even if you understand this</text><text start="423.68" dur="3.6">the thing that really had me scratching</text><text start="425.24" dur="4.399">my head when Quinn showed me this demo</text><text start="427.28" dur="4.84">was why you would see diagonal stripes</text><text start="429.639" dur="4.481">when you view the cylinder from the side</text><text start="432.12" dur="3.799">I mean take a moment to think about this</text><text start="434.12" dur="3.199">at any point down the tube even though</text><text start="435.919" dur="3.601">all the colors have been rotated</text><text start="437.319" dur="4.481">differently again the light at that</text><text start="439.52" dur="4.2">point is still white it&amp;#39;s still an equal</text><text start="441.8" dur="3.48">balance of all the different colors if</text><text start="443.72" dur="3.64">you were to stick your eye inside the</text><text start="445.28" dur="4.08">tube and look towards the lamp you would</text><text start="447.36" dur="4.88">see white so why would viewing it from</text><text start="449.36" dur="4.44">the the side change what you see the way</text><text start="452.24" dur="3.76">I&amp;#39;ve made this animation I&amp;#39;ve just left</text><text start="453.8" dur="3.799">a faint Shadow representing the wiggling</text><text start="456" dur="4.28">direction for each color along the way</text><text start="457.599" dur="5.04">down the tube but that&amp;#39;s just a cartoon</text><text start="460.28" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s a schematic representation why is</text><text start="462.639" dur="3.441">it that the actual way that light</text><text start="464.36" dur="3.6">interacts with the molecules within the</text><text start="466.08" dur="3.799">tube would discriminate between the</text><text start="467.96" dur="3.799">colors in any way and why would the</text><text start="469.879" dur="3.641">stripes be diagonal wouldn&amp;#39;t you think</text><text start="471.759" dur="4.321">the setup should be completely symmetric</text><text start="473.52" dur="2.56">from top to</text><text start="476.479" dur="4.28">bottom so these are the main questions</text><text start="478.879" dur="4.121">we need to answer answer why would sugar</text><text start="480.759" dur="4.12">cause the light to twist why would the</text><text start="483" dur="4.12">rate at which it twists depend on the</text><text start="484.879" dur="4.241">frequency of the light and why even if</text><text start="487.12" dur="4.079">you understand both those facts would</text><text start="489.12" dur="3.639">you be seeing different colors appear in</text><text start="491.199" dur="3.801">these diagonal</text><text start="492.759" dur="4.481">Stripes you can answer these questions</text><text start="495" dur="4.879">if you have a handful of key intuitions</text><text start="497.24" dur="5">about Optics the first question requires</text><text start="499.879" dur="5.361">understanding circularly polarized light</text><text start="502.24" dur="4.84">since the key is that sucrose is a chyal</text><text start="505.24" dur="3.519">molecule which is to say there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="507.08" dur="3">handedness to it it&amp;#39;s different from its</text><text start="508.759" dur="2.961">mirror image</text><text start="510.08" dur="3.319">and the slightly different effects that</text><text start="511.72" dur="3.879">it has on right-handed versus</text><text start="513.399" dur="5.241">left-handed circularly polarized light</text><text start="515.599" dur="5.201">ends up explaining the twist the second</text><text start="518.64" dur="4.199">question requires understanding why</text><text start="520.8" dur="4.8">light appears to slow down when it</text><text start="522.839" dur="4.321">passes through a material a sufficiently</text><text start="525.6" dur="3.64">mathematical understanding for where</text><text start="527.16" dur="4.48">that slowdown comes from ultimately</text><text start="529.24" dur="3.84">explains the color separation here and</text><text start="531.64" dur="3.36">the third question comes down to the</text><text start="533.08" dur="4.28">fact that when light scatters off of a</text><text start="535" dur="4.519">material it&amp;#39;s not like some projectile</text><text start="537.36" dur="4.24">bouncing in any old Direction the</text><text start="539.519" dur="3.961">direction of scattering depends on the</text><text start="541.6" dur="4">direction of polarization and there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="543.48" dur="5.039">very good reason for</text><text start="545.6" dur="5.08">it my aim is for all of these answers to</text><text start="548.519" dur="4.081">feel less like facts that I&amp;#39;m handing</text><text start="550.68" dur="4.04">down from on high and more like</text><text start="552.6" dur="4.28">inevitable discoveries emerging from a</text><text start="554.72" dur="4.64">fundamental understanding for what light</text><text start="556.88" dur="4.72">actually is for that we&amp;#39;ll Begin by</text><text start="559.36" dur="5.44">returning to that question number zero</text><text start="561.6" dur="5.56">what exactly is wiggling which is to say</text><text start="564.8" dur="4.2">what is light if you&amp;#39;re curious about</text><text start="567.16" dur="3.6">how the full explanation unfolds come</text><text start="569" dur="5.079">join me in the next</text><text start="570.76" dur="5.519">video it&amp;#39;s really surprising I&amp;#39;m really</text><text start="574.079" dur="3.921">surprised you notice it in person as</text><text start="576.279" dur="3.281">well presumably it&amp;#39;s not just something</text><text start="578" dur="3.2">that appears in the camera it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="579.56"
