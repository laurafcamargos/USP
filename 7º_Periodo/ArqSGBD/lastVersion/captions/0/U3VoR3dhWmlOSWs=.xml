you on the</text><text start="141.04" dur="4.76">top of their own to-do lists the second</text><text start="143.64" dur="4.48">thing to talk about are the daily Musto</text><text start="145.8" dur="4.2">lists on your computer you should make a</text><text start="148.12" dur="3.68">Word document that has a blank page for</text><text start="150" dur="3.44">each work day on those pages you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="151.8" dur="3.68">going to put down the things that must</text><text start="153.44" dur="4.92">happen by the end of that day in order</text><text start="155.48" dur="5">to be fully prepared for the next day so</text><text start="158.36" dur="3.64">as an example every Monday you need to</text><text start="160.48" dur="3.44">list all of the classes that you need to</text><text start="162" dur="3.159">plan for on Tuesday if there&amp;#39;s anything</text><text start="163.92" dur="3.36">else that needs to be done before</text><text start="165.159" dur="3.36">Tuesday also put that on that list the</text><text start="167.28" dur="3.679">thing that really makes this work is</text><text start="168.519" dur="4.36">that it is a Musto list this is not a</text><text start="170.959" dur="3.481">daily to-do list you&amp;#39;re not putting down</text><text start="172.879" dur="3">things that you would like to get done</text><text start="174.44"

to</text><text start="180.319" dur="4.56">think of this as my I must do this</text><text start="182.28" dur="3.879">before I can go home list if you limit</text><text start="184.879" dur="3.041">your list to only the things that</text><text start="186.159" dur="3.36">absolutely have to get done it&amp;#39;s much</text><text start="187.92" dur="2.879">more motivating to knock those things</text><text start="189.519" dur="2.561">off so you know you can go home at the</text><text start="190.799" dur="2.8">end of the day and not have to be</text><text start="192.08" dur="3">worrying all night about what you need</text><text start="193.599" dur="2.601">to do first thing in the morning to be</text><text start="195.08" dur="3.12">ready for the</text><text start="196.2" dur="4.039">day the last thing to keep on the</text><text start="198.2" dur="3.52">clipboard is a general to-do list this</text><text start="200.239" dur="4.681">is a list for everything that doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="201.72" dur="5.56">fit on your Musto lists anything that is</text><text start="204.92" dur="3.879">less time sensitive goes on here any</text><text start="207.28" dur="3.72">general project that you need to do at</text><text start="208.799" dur="4.241">some point but not by a specific day</text><text start="211" dur="4.08">will be kept track of on here after</text><text start="213.04" dur="3.36">you&amp;#39;ve crossed off your Musto list then</text><text start="215.08" dur="2.76">you would turn over to your general</text><text start="216.4" dur="3.039">to-do list and start working through</text><text start="217.84" dur="3.64">those items if you have</text><text start="219.439" dur="4.16">time the next thing I want to talk about</text><text start="221.48" dur="3.64">is paperwork teachers deal with a lot of</text><text start="223.599" dur="3.441">paper and you have to have a system for</text><text start="225.12" dur="4.24">keeping it all together this is what I</text><text start="227.04" dur="4.72">recommend you should have one folder for</text><text start="229.36" dur="3.92">each class that you teach within that</text><text start="231.76" dur="3.44">folder you&amp;#39;re going to keep all of the</text><text start="233.28" dur="4.879">papers that you currently need to teach</text><text start="235.2" dur="4.599">that class so any worksheets that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="238.159" dur="3.481">going to give out any tests you&amp;#39;re going</text><text start="239.799" dur="3.72">to give out homework that you&amp;#39;ve gotten</text><text start="241.64" dur="4.28">back and need to mark all of those kinds</text><text start="243.519" dur="3.92">of things go into this folder any</text><text start="245.92" dur="3.319">reference materials that you wouldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="247.439" dur="3.72">need on a particular day to teach that</text><text start="249.239" dur="4.08">class such as workbooks that you use to</text><text start="251.159" dur="4.04">photocopy the worksheets from those you</text><text start="253.319" dur="4.04">can keep in a separate filing</text><text start="255.199" dur="4.521">cabinet here&amp;#39;s an example of the kind of</text><text start="257.359" dur="3.641">thing to keep inside one of the folders</text><text start="259.72" dur="3.84">this is a collection of papers that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="261" dur="4.04">for a year 10 test there&amp;#39;s three parts</text><text start="263.56" dur="3.68">to this little packet so let&amp;#39;s take a</text><text start="265.04" dur="4.12">look at them first there&amp;#39;s the papers</text><text start="267.24" dur="3.56">themselves secondly there&amp;#39;s a title</text><text start="269.16" dur="4.36">sheet that clearly describes what they</text><text start="270.8" dur="4.44">are in this example year 10 tests and</text><text start="273.52" dur="3.6">lastly there&amp;#39;s a cover slip which keeps</text><text start="275.24" dur="3.36">all of these things together if you</text><text start="277.12" dur="3.24">leave a lot of blank space in your cover</text><text start="278.6" dur="3.56">sheet you can add additional information</text><text start="280.36" dur="3.279">later on such as when you&amp;#39;ve given the</text><text start="282.16" dur="3.72">test to the students and received them</text><text start="283.639" dur="3.441">back you can add to mark on the front of</text><text start="285.88" dur="3.039">that sheet so that you know you need to</text><text start="287.08" dur="3.72">take care of this and once you&amp;#39;ve marked</text><text start="288.919" dur="4">them you can then cross that out again</text><text start="290.8" dur="4.239">to quickly review keep one folder for</text><text start="292.919" dur="3.881">each of your classes and keep all of the</text><text start="295.039" dur="3.681">things that you need to teach that class</text><text start="296.8" dur="3.32">in that folder once you set up the</text><text start="298.72" dur="3.16">system you know that you just need that</text><text start="300.12" dur="3.48">single folder to be adequately prepared</text><text start="301.88" dur="3.2">for the class this is also convenient in</text><text start="303.6" dur="3.76">case there&amp;#39;s a room change you can just</text><text start="305.08" dur="3.8">grab that folder and go if you&amp;#39;re able</text><text start="307.36" dur="3.32">to organize your files in the way that</text><text start="308.88" dur="3.8">I&amp;#39;ve just recommended and you&amp;#39;re able to</text><text start="310.68" dur="3.92">consistently work with your daily Musto</text><text start="312.68" dur="3.56">list the advantage is that when you walk</text><text start="314.6" dur="3.159">into school on any day you know that</text><text start="316.24" dur="3.48">you&amp;#39;re completely ready for whatever is</text><text start="317.759" dur="3.681">going to happen you don&amp;#39;t have to spend</text><text start="319.72" dur="3.319">any of your day frantically planning for</text><text start="321.44" dur="3.319">that afternoon lesson and if anything</text><text start="323.039" dur="3.44">comes up unexpectedly you don&amp;#39;t have to</text><text start="324.759" dur="3.641">worry about it because you&amp;#39;re all set</text><text start="326.479" dur="4.041">for every one of your lessons for that</text><text start="328.4" dur="3.6">day once you start getting used to this</text><text start="330.52" dur="3">ready position you&amp;#39;ll find that you have</text><text start="332" dur="3.6">more time in the day than you actually</text><text start="333.52" dur="3.64">originally thought one of the places</text><text start="335.6" dur="3.52">that time has been hiding from you is in</text><text start="337.16" dur="4.28">these little 5minute intervals between</text><text start="339.12" dur="4">lessons after the last class leaves and</text><text start="341.44" dur="3.24">before the next class comes in you can</text><text start="343.12" dur="2.6">use this time in a productive way if</text><text start="344.68" dur="3.079">you&amp;#39;re prepared</text><text start="345.72" dur="3.479">adequately I recommend that you keep a</text><text start="347.759" dur="3.961">list of things that you can do in these</text><text start="349.199" dur="4.521">little five minute times for example you</text><text start="351.72" dur="3.88">can do some quick filing or if you have</text><text start="353.72" dur="3.44">an easy to mark quiz you can Mark a</text><text start="355.6" dur="3.64">couple of pages in that</text><text start="357.16" dur="3.08">quiz after a full day of teaching you</text><text start="359.24" dur="2.88">can sometimes times fun that you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="360.24" dur="3.32">marked a complete class set of quizzes</text><text start="362.12" dur="3.519">without ever
