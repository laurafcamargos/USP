pattern there is this wonderful</text><text start="13.12" dur="3.36">mathematical</text><text start="14.28" dur="3.96">idea part of the reason we find it</text><text start="16.48" dur="3.08">beautiful is because of its inherent</text><text start="18.24" dur="4.08">Symmetry and</text><text start="19.56" dur="4.959">proportion if you understand how</text><text start="22.32" dur="4.08">something is put together if you can see</text><text start="24.519" dur="5.481">that behind that beautiful form of</text><text start="26.4" dur="6.039">poetry art and music and literature the</text><text start="30" dur="5.16">beauty of architecture those shapes that</text><text start="32.439" dur="4.881">nature produces that&amp;#39;s all mathematics</text><text start="35.16" dur="2.16">as</text><text start="38.719" dur="5.041">well my main research area has been</text><text start="41.68" dur="3.6">group Theory really it&amp;#39;s the study of</text><text start="43.76" dur="4.639">symmetry that&amp;#39;s how I like to think of</text><text start="45.28" dur="5.88">it a group is just a collection of</text><text start="48.399" dur="6.241">things which could be numbers it could</text><text start="51.16" dur="5.36">be functions it could be matrices all of</text><text start="54.64" dur="5.399">these things can form groups but the one</text><text start="56.52" dur="6.719">I like the most is groups of symmetries</text><text start="60.039" dur="5.12">numbers shapes symmetry all of those</text><text start="63.239" dur="3.161">things are there in the universe the</text><text start="65.159" dur="3.761">nature around</text><text start="66.4" dur="5.039">us and this one here this beautiful</text><text start="68.92" dur="4.36">flower it&amp;#39;s got five petals and that</text><text start="71.439" dur="4.161">means it&amp;#39;s got a fivefold symmetry you</text><text start="73.28" dur="3">can rotate it 1/ fif of the way around</text><text start="75.6" dur="4.24">the</text><text start="76.28" dur="5.92">circle you get lots of numbers like 5 8</text><text start="79.84" dur="5.639">13 that form part of the Fibonacci</text><text start="82.2" dur="5.12">sequence which is very very useful in</text><text start="85.479" dur="5.561">terms of plant growth because it relates</text><text start="87.32" dur="5.52">to something called the golden ratio</text><text start="91.04" dur="3.96">if you look at a sunflower there are</text><text start="92.84" dur="4.599">loads of spiles with Fibonacci numbers</text><text start="95" dur="4.479">of seeds in them so the gold number is</text><text start="97.439" dur="4.72">there for sure and you see it as well in</text><text start="99.479" dur="4.64">some of the Spiral shapes of seashells</text><text start="102.159" dur="4.041">we have not invented the golden ratio</text><text start="104.119" dur="4.6">right we&amp;#39;ve discovered it and we see it</text><text start="106.2" dur="2.519">all over</text><text start="111.36" dur="6.24">nature this is the absolute load Stone</text><text start="114.6" dur="5.4">of symmetry where I live these beautiful</text><text start="117.6" dur="4.92">designs created by William Morris with</text><text start="120" dur="5.079">Botanical themes plants and animals he</text><text start="122.52" dur="4.919">made Fabrics tapestries he made</text><text start="125.079" dur="3.88">wallpapers there are 17 different kinds</text><text start="127.439" dur="3.6">of wallpaper now this seems</text><text start="128.959" dur="4">counterintuitive because of course there</text><text start="131.039" dur="4.521">are as many kinds of wallpaper as you</text><text start="132.959" dur="5">could design but what we&amp;#39;re talking</text><text start="135.56" dur="5.52">about there is the ways that the</text><text start="137.959" dur="5.401">patterns can fit together these designs</text><text start="141.08" dur="4.76">they&amp;#39;re all different but what they have</text><text start="143.36" dur="4.159">in common is that they all have symmetry</text><text start="145.84" dur="4.92">to</text><text start="147.519" dur="5.401">them the famous artist MC designed lots</text><text start="150.76" dur="3.88">of repeating patterns and tessellations</text><text start="152.92" dur="4.48">he learned about the 17 wallpaper</text><text start="154.64" dur="4.64">patterns from his brother who was a</text><text start="157.4" dur="4.08">crystallographer and then of course Asha</text><text start="159.28" dur="3.64">produces all these wonderful designs um</text><text start="161.48" dur="3.96">that we all know and</text><text start="162.92" dur="4.64">love this collection of structures</text><text start="165.44" dur="4.879">actually has applications beyond the</text><text start="167.56" dur="4.319">design of wallpaper for instance Crystal</text><text start="170.319" dur="3.84">structures now if you think of the</text><text start="171.879" dur="5.481">layers of atoms that form inside a</text><text start="174.159" dur="5">crystal there are these 17 possibilities</text><text start="177.36" dur="3.879">so what&amp;#39;s a symmetry something you can</text><text start="179.159" dur="4.041">do to that design that leaves it looking</text><text start="181.239" dur="3.92">the same there are lots of vertical</text><text start="183.2" dur="3.24">mirror lines you could draw reflect this</text><text start="185.159" dur="5.08">design it&amp;#39;s going to look the same</text><text start="186.44" dur="6.04">either way you could also shift it along</text><text start="190.239" dur="5.56">in steps so you could translate it</text><text start="192.48" dur="4.72">that&amp;#39;s the mathematical word so it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="195.799" dur="4.121">very very cool the way the symmetries</text><text start="197.2" dur="4.599">can combine like this and that&amp;#39;s one of</text><text start="199.92" dur="3.679">the properties that they must satisfy to</text><text start="201.799" dur="4">form this algebraic object called a</text><text start="203.599" dur="3.64">group so in this case we&amp;#39;ve got a</text><text start="205.799" dur="3.72">collection of all the symmetries of this</text><text start="207.239" dur="6.481">beautiful design and anytime you combine</text><text start="209.519" dur="7.28">any of them the outcome is still another</text><text start="213.72" dur="7.159">symmetry just</text><text start="216.799" dur="4.08">check two three four</text><text start="221.72" dur="5">five there&amp;#39;s not one connection between</text><text start="224.36" dur="4.239">mathematics and music there are many</text><text start="226.72" dur="4.56">it&amp;#39;s got so much mathematics in The</text><text start="228.599" dur="4.56">rhythms the patterns even the counting</text><text start="231.28" dur="3.879">the way that frequencies match up to</text><text start="233.159" dur="4.72">produce sounds that we find pleasing</text><text start="235.159" dur="5.16">together the mathematician liit said</text><text start="237.879" dur="3.92">that music is what happens when we do</text><text start="240.319" dur="3.681">mathematics</text><text start="241.799" dur="4.761">unconsciously you can&amp;#39;t listen to a</text><text start="244" dur="5.239">piece of bar without knowing that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="246.56" dur="4.16">mathematical the beautiful patterns and</text><text start="249.239" dur="3.601">symmetries in that music if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="250.72" dur="4.56">listening to a Fugue or playing a Fugue</text><text start="252.84" dur="4.44">on the piano um you&amp;#39;ll get a theme that</text><text start="255.28" dur="4">comes in and then it comes back but it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="257.28" dur="4.639">upside down inverted or it might be</text><text start="259.28" dur="5.359">retrograde backwards or it might be</text><text start="261.919" dur="4.761">translated up or down so these are just</text><text start="264.639" dur="5.4">the same kinds of symmetries that we saw</text><text start="266.68" dur="5.239">in the in the wallpaper right</text><text start="270.039" dur="4.6">people somehow they get put off the idea</text><text start="271.919" dur="4.521">of mathematics they think mathematics is</text><text start="274.639" dur="5.12">about numbers and numbers are not</text><text start="276.44" dur="5.92">creative they&amp;#39;re rigid whereas art is</text><text start="279.759" dur="4.521">more free and creative actually of</text><text start="282.36" dur="4.04">course that is that is not right the</text><text start="284.28" dur="3.759">most creative subject for me is</text><text start="286.4" dur="4.6">mathematics it&amp;#39;s just that we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="288.039" dur="6.121">creating with with ideas with patterns</text><text start="291" dur="5.16">so yes music is mathematics just as art</text><text start="294.16" dur="3.65">is mathematics and so is literature</text><text start="296.16" dur="13.489">everything is mathematics</text><text start="297.81" dur="11.839">[Music]</text></transcript>
