dur="4.879">the mystery being that when your brain</text><text start="19.4" dur="5.24">cells fire in certain patterns it</text><text start="22.199" dur="5.801">actually feels like something it might</text><text start="24.64" dur="5.879">feel like jealousy or a toothache or the</text><text start="28" dur="5">memory of your mother&amp;#39;s face or the</text><text start="30.519"

right now for</text><text start="37.28" dur="4.4">instance I&amp;#39;m probably forming some</text><text start="39" dur="5.079">memory somewhere deep in my brain but</text><text start="41.68" dur="5.6">the process of that memory formation is</text><text start="44.079" dur="5.041">imperceptible to me I can&amp;#39;t feel it it</text><text start="47.28" dur="4.759">doesn&amp;#39;t give rise to any sort of</text><text start="49.12" dur="5.36">internal subjective experience at all in</text><text start="52.039" dur="5.52">other words I&amp;#39;m not conscious of it so</text><text start="54.48" dur="6.2">how does Consciousness happen how is it</text><text start="57.559" dur="6.761">related to physics and biology</text><text start="60.68" dur="5.4">are animals conscious what about plants</text><text start="64.32" dur="4.72">or computers could they ever be</text><text start="66.08" dur="6.079">conscious and what is consciousness</text><text start="69.04" dur="5.32">exactly my guest today Dr annel Seth</text><text start="72.159" dur="4.241">studies Consciousness in his role as the</text><text start="74.36" dur="4.32">co-director of the Sussex Center for</text><text

for being here thanks for having</text><text start="102.84" dur="4.84">me it&amp;#39;s a pleasure to be on with you</text><text start="104.84" dur="5.12">well this is I have to say one of my</text><text start="107.68" dur="5.079">favorite and most perplexing things to</text><text start="109.96" dur="5.119">think about I don&amp;#39;t really know where to</text><text start="112.759" dur="4.96">start with it I mean Consciousness is so</text><text start="115.079" dur="4.441">mysterious I sometimes have this uncanny</text><text start="117.719" dur="3.32">sensation maybe like once or twice a</text><text start="119.52" dur="4.639">year I&amp;#39;ll be looking in the bathroom</text><text start="121.039" dur="6.841">mirror shaving and then I get this</text><text start="124.159" dur="6.44">creepy feeling like what is this lump of</text><text start="127.88" dur="4.52">matter looking back at me in the mirror</text><text start="130.599" dur="4.441">like who&amp;#39;s in there yeah welcome to my</text><text start="132.4" dur="4.76">world this I do this sounds like a</text><text start="135.04" dur="4.04">description of every day you know in one</text><text start="137.16" dur="3.24">sense you leave the mystery behind when</text><text start="139.08" dur="3.64">you go and make dinner and lead your</text><text start="140.4" dur="5.52">normal life but it does have this habit</text><text start="142.72" dur="5.36">of going everywhere with you and most</text><text start="145.92" dur="5.039">days I&amp;#39;ll have a moment like that and I</text><text start="148.08" dur="5.32">will try and train myself also just to</text><text start="150.959" dur="4.801">continually reflect meditate on this</text><text start="153.4" dur="5.6">everyday miracle that we have this</text><text start="155.76" dur="5.559">electrified Pate inside our skull and</text><text start="159" dur="5">that somehow in conjunction with the</text><text start="161.319" dur="5.321">body and its interaction with the world</text><text start="164" dur="5.599">there isn&amp;#39;t just complicated biological</text><text start="166.64" dur="5.879">Machinery chugging away there is</text><text start="169.599" dur="4.92">subjective experience it feels like</text><text start="172.519" dur="4.841">something to be me and it feels like</text><text start="174.519" dur="4.08">something to be you to use a definition</text><text start="177.36" dur="3.04">that comes from the philosopher Thomas</text><text start="178.599" dur="4.481">Nagel and that</text><text start="180.4" dur="4.88">is really still quite astounding it</text><text start="183.08" dur="5.2">doesn&amp;#39;t feel like anything to be a table</text><text start="185.28" dur="5.92">or a chair but this is the fundamental</text><text start="188.28" dur="4.56">mystery of Consciousness and it&amp;#39;s both a</text><text start="191.2" dur="3.64">deep scientific and philosophical</text><text start="192.84" dur="4.08">mystery but a very personal mystery</text><text start="194.84" dur="4.64">because part of the feeling like is the</text><text start="196.92" dur="4.879">feeling of being a particular person</text><text start="199.48" dur="4.679">being the individual that you are being</text><text start="201.799" dur="4.961">you or being me you&amp;#39;ve just introduce</text><text start="204.159" dur="4.881">the word self you can be conscious of</text><text start="206.76" dur="5.039">various things you can also be conscious</text><text start="209.04" dur="5.6">of having a self should we start to try</text><text start="211.799" dur="4.601">to tease apart the different concepts</text><text start="214.64" dur="3.64">related to Consciousness what is</text><text start="216.4" dur="3.6">consciousness how is it different from</text><text start="218.28" dur="4.4">self-consciousness I think that&amp;#39;s a good</text><text start="220" dur="4.64">idea there&amp;#39;s always this problem with</text><text start="222.68" dur="4.32">definition when it comes to a poorly</text><text start="224.64" dur="4.72">understood phenomenon looking back at</text><text start="227" dur="3.92">the history of science I think we both</text><text start="229.36" dur="3.599">know that definitions aren&amp;#39;t sort of</text><text start="230.92" dur="4.36">written in stone and you you settle on</text><text start="232.959" dur="4.521">one and then you just try and figure out</text><text start="235.28" dur="4.239">what the underlying science is the</text><text start="237.48" dur="3.72">definitions always evolve along with our</text><text start="239.519" dur="3.92">understanding in and so for</text><text start="241.2" dur="3.879">Consciousness the place I start is with</text><text start="243.439" dur="4.041">this definition from the philosopher</text><text start="245.079" dur="3.36">Thomas Nagel who simply said for a</text><text start="247.48" dur="3.2">conscious</text><text start="248.439" dur="4.601">organism there is something it is like</text><text start="250.68" dur="3.8">to be that organism it feels like</text><text start="253.04" dur="4.159">something to be yeah that&amp;#39;s fairly</text><text start="254.48" dur="4.68">circular but I like it because it hits</text><text start="257.199" dur="4">the Bull&amp;#39;s Eye that it&amp;#39;s just talking</text><text start="259.16" dur="4.84">about experience and it&amp;#39;s useful for</text><text start="261.199" dur="5">what it leaves out it&amp;#39;s often tempting</text><text start="264" dur="4.24">and this has happened before and in many</text><text start="266.199" dur="3.681">other examples of associating</text><text start="268.24" dur="4">Consciousness implicitly with something</text><text start="269.88" dur="4.92">else whether that&amp;#39;s intelligence or</text><text start="272.24" dur="6.12">having language or behaving in a</text><text start="274.8" dur="5.399">particular way or knowing who I am you</text><text start="278.36" dur="4.44">know an explicit reflective sense of</text><text start="280.199" dur="4.681">self all of these things may be aspects</text><text start="282.8" dur="4.52">of human consciousness but Consciousness</text><text start="284.88" dur="3.759">in general is not the same as any of</text><text start="287.32" dur="2.4">these other things it&amp;#39;s just the raw</text><text start="288.639" dur="3.641">fact of</text><text start="289.72" dur="5.24">experiencing but then within that there</text><text start="292.28" dur="3.8">are indeed further divisions that you</text><text start="294.96" dur="4.079">can make and I think this is</text><text start="296.08" dur="4.6">heuristically useful in dividing up the</text><text start="299.039" dur="3.281">problem so we can get at Consciousness</text><text start="300.68" dur="3.88">from a kind of divide and conquer</text><text start="302.32" dur="4.12">strategy and there three ways that I</text><text start="304.56" dur="4.359">like to do it there&amp;#39;s level being</text><text start="306.44" dur="4.199">conscious at all like when you lose it</text><text start="308.919" dur="4.081">when you&amp;#39;re under general anesthesia or</text><text start="310.639" dur="5.041">in dreamless sleep then you&amp;#39;re conscious</text><text start="313" dur="4.44">of what&amp;#39;s around you the world and then</text><text start="315.68" dur="3.799">within that there&amp;#39;s the experience of</text><text start="317.44" dur="4.12">being a self of being the person that</text><text start="319.479" dur="3.921">you are I thought that was a terrific</text><text start="321.56" dur="3.96">aspect of your book as far as</text><text start="323.4" dur="4.68">helpfulness to me as a reader to be able</text><text start="325.52" dur="5">to think about chopping up the problem</text><text start="328.08" dur="5.04">in various ways you mentioned four</text><text start="330.52" dur="5.519">levels the level of Consciousness the</text><text start="333.12" dur="4.96">issue of what you call the content or</text><text start="336.039" dur="5.521">contents of Consciousness what we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="338.08" dur="6.04">conscious of or what we perceive</text><text start="341.56" dur="4.8">consciousness of self and then the</text><text start="344.12" dur="4.68">fourth one you say is this really</text><text start="346.36" dur="3.72">profound mystery of being you well I</text><text start="348.8" dur="3.2">actually think the third and the fourth</text><text start="350.08" dur="4.679">are rather the same okay fine but there</text><text start="352" dur="6.039">are many ways of experiencing being a</text><text start="354.759" dur="6.081">self so we can have experiences of self</text><text start="358.039" dur="4.801">without knowing that we&amp;#39;re having these</text><text start="360.84" dur="3.72">experiences I can experience being</text><text start="362.84" dur="4.6">associated with this object that&amp;#39;s my</text><text start="364.56" dur="5.199">body and I can have emotions and moods</text><text start="367.44" dur="4.92">and all of that can in principle unfold</text><text start="369.759" dur="5.761">without attaching a name and a set of</text><text start="372.36" dur="5.92">memories to it so there are within each</text><text start="375.52" dur="5.36">of these areas of content and level and</text><text start="378.28" dur="4.8">self there are of course more fine grain</text><text start="380.88" dur="4.8">distinctions that we can make and and we</text><text start="383.08" dur="4.8">can ask whether these these finer grain</text><text start="385.68" dur="4">distinctions have any traction in the</text><text start="387.88" dur="5.159">laboratory or the clinic do they pick</text><text start="389.68" dur="4.72">out joins in nature or do they not or</text><text start="393.039" dur="2.88">are they things we just sort of make up</text><text start="394.4" dur="3.68">and that&amp;#39;s part of I think the game of</text><text start="395.919" dur="5.081">Consciousness research we can figure out</text><text start="398.08" dur="5.44">which of our distinctions have Traction</text><text start="401" dur="4.319">in the real world great and I do</text><text start="403.52" dur="4">appreciate that because on this podcast</text><text start="405.319" dur="4">we try to talk about science especially</text><text start="407.52" dur="3.519">big mysteries in science but I would</text><text start="409.319" dur="4.361">want to underline the word science that</text><text start="411.039" dur="4.921">there are things we can ponder that are</text><text start="413.68" dur="5.959">outside the realm of science not even</text><text start="415.96" dur="6.359">testable or refutable in principle and I</text><text start="419.639" dur="4.481">take it that you really are focused on</text><text start="422.319" dur="3.801">the scientific side of Consciousness I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="424.12" dur="4.28">sure your philosophical side likes</text><text start="426.12" dur="3.32">pondering the unanswerable as well well</text><text start="428.4" dur="3.04">I don&amp;#39;t think philosophy is just</text><text start="429.44" dur="4.039">pondering the unanswerable I think</text><text start="431.44" dur="5.199">science and philosophy really work</text><text start="433.479" dur="6.081">together in understanding something for</text><text start="436.639" dur="4.801">which it&amp;#39;s not clear what a satisfactory</text><text start="439.56" dur="4">understanding would look like you know</text><text start="441.44" dur="4.039">we don&amp;#39;t necessarily need philosophy if</text><text start="443.56" dur="3.639">we are at the stage of the Human Genome</text><text start="445.479" dur="2.681">Project where we know exactly what we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="447.199" dur="3.56">doing and it&amp;#39;s just a sort of</text><text start="448.16" dur="4.2">engineering problem of of how we do it</text><text start="450.759" dur="4.081">but when it comes to Consciousness</text><text start="452.36" dur="4.8">there&amp;#39;s still a mystery not only about</text><text start="454.84" dur="4.84">how it happens but about what a</text><text start="457.16" dur="4.479">successful answer would even look like</text><text start="459.68" dur="4.199">so science and philosophy really still</text><text start="461.639" dur="4.28">need each other you the one science</text><text start="463.879" dur="4.201">without philosophy is a bit blind and</text><text start="465.919" dur="5">and philosophy without science is a bit</text><text start="468.08" dur="5.679">lame so I&amp;#39;ve never formerly studied</text><text start="470.919" dur="4.72">philosophy but it&amp;#39;s always been in my</text><text start="473.759" dur="4">environment and I&amp;#39;ve benefited</text><text start="475.639" dur="4.201">enormously from talking to and</text><text start="477.759" dur="4.961">collaborating with philosophers and even</text><text start="479.84" dur="5.079">trying out some philosophical ideas my</text><text start="482.72" dur="5.12">myself I think we need it it keeps</text><text start="484.919" dur="6.321">science honest and it helps guide it to</text><text start="487.84" dur="5.52">the right kinds of questions but I think</text><text start="491.24" dur="3.919">there&amp;#39;s still approaches to</text><text start="493.36" dur="3.399">Consciousness which I find less</text><text start="495.159" dur="3.961">appealing which are those that are in</text><text start="496.759" dur="5.16">principle non-testable which may be</text><text start="499.12" dur="5.32">purely philosophical positions there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="501.919" dur="4.921">position that&amp;#39;s becoming quite popular</text><text start="504.44" dur="5.24">these days called pans psychism which is</text><text start="506.84" dur="5.28">this idea that Consciousness isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="509.68" dur="4.2">something that brains generate or that</text><text start="512.12" dur="4.44">is identical to particular kinds of</text><text start="513.88" dur="5.92">brain processes or biological processes</text><text start="516.56" dur="4.88">but that it&amp;#39;s fundamental and ubiquitous</text><text start="519.8" dur="5.4">that it&amp;#39;s somehow everywhere and in</text><text start="521.44" dur="5.92">everything like charge or or mass energy</text><text start="525.2" dur="3.639">this is maybe superficially an appealing</text><text start="527.36" dur="3.12">idea because if you just say</text><text start="528.839" dur="4.081">Consciousness is there from the get-go</text><text start="530.48" dur="4.479">then you don&amp;#39;t have to explain how it</text><text start="532.92" dur="4.359">comes about in certain places and not</text><text start="534.959" dur="4">others but it doesn&amp;#39;t really explain</text><text start="537.279" dur="3.56">anything and it&amp;#39;s not only that it&amp;#39;s not</text><text start="538.959" dur="2.921">testable it doesn&amp;#39;t lead to anything</text><text start="540.839" dur="4.12">that could be</text><text start="541.88" dur="5.56">testable and it&amp;#39;s that that I find</text><text start="544.959" dur="4.44">offputting that I think philosophical</text><text start="547.44" dur="3.959">perspectives they&amp;#39;re rarely themselves</text><text start="549.399" dur="3.88">testable like materialism The View that</text><text start="551.399" dur="3.641">I sort of work with the idea that</text><text start="553.279" dur="5.321">Consciousness is a natural phenomenon</text><text start="555.04" dur="6.479">and is somehow a property of material</text><text start="558.6" dur="6.16">things like brains and bodies that</text><text start="561.519" dur="6.521">itself is probably not testable but what</text><text start="564.76" dur="6.759">it does do is it leads to things that</text><text start="568.04" dur="5.32">are testable and over time allows us to</text><text start="571.519" dur="3.401">explain things about Consciousness that</text><text start="573.36" dur="3.4">we would otherwise not be able to</text><text start="574.92" dur="4.159">explain I appreciate your use of the</text><text start="576.76" dur="4.6">word explain here because I&amp;#39;d like to</text><text start="579.079" dur="4.281">get into the question of what you have</text><text start="581.36" dur="3.76">sometimes called the real problem of</text><text start="583.36" dur="4.32">Consciousness as opposed to the easy</text><text start="585.12" dur="6.68">problem so what is the real problem the</text><text start="587.68" dur="6.599">real problem is how to explain predict</text><text start="591.8" dur="4.32">and maybe even control properties of</text><text start="594.279" dur="4.68">Consciousness in terms of their</text><text start="596.12" dur="3.88">underlying mechanisms in the brain and</text><text start="598.959" dur="3.361">the body</text><text start="600" dur="3.92">and that sounds sort of an obvious thing</text><text start="602.32" dur="3.959">to that we should be trying to do right</text><text start="603.92" dur="3.88">but it&amp;#39;s actually not so much because</text><text start="606.279" dur="3.68">these properties of Consciousness that</text><text start="607.8" dur="6.76">I&amp;#39;m talking about that we should try to</text><text start="609.959" dur="6.681">explain they are primarily experential</text><text start="614.56" dur="3.92">or what we would call phenomenological</text><text start="616.64" dur="4.319">properties which is an incredibly long</text><text start="618.48" dur="4.44">word but what it really just means is</text><text start="620.959" dur="3.841">the way in which conscious experiences</text><text start="622.92" dur="4.44">appear as experiences not what they</text><text start="624.8" dur="4.039">allow us to do so much or what functions</text><text start="627.36" dur="4.24">they might have in terms of the</text><text start="628.839" dur="5.12">cognitive architecture of the brain why</text><text start="631.6" dur="4.44">is a visual experience the way it is and</text><text start="633.959" dur="4">different from an

half</text><text start="1457.12" dur="4.64">the world saw the dress as being blue</text><text start="1460.12" dur="6.08">and black and the other half of the</text><text start="1461.76" dur="7.279">world saw it as being white and gold and</text><text start="1466.2" dur="4.12">what was fascinating about this was not</text><text start="1469.039" dur="3.401">so much that there&amp;#39;s a sort of weird</text><text start="1470.32" dur="5">illusion of color going on here but the</text><text start="1472.44" dur="5.44">conviction with which people held on to</text><text start="1475.32"

dur="3.161">sounds maybe it&amp;#39;s a hoax or it&amp;#39;s fake or</text><text start="1488.88" dur="2.64">something I thought well that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1489.72" dur="4.92">definitely a blue and black dress and</text><text start="1491.52" dur="4.6">the first five people I asked in the lab</text><text start="1494.64" dur="2.96">they also said blue and black and I</text><text

start="1537.64" dur="7.12">color Vision Works if you take a piece</text><text start="1540.44" dur="6.719">of white paper from outside indoors it</text><text start="1544.76" dur="4.919">still looks the same shade of white</text><text start="1547.159" dur="4.281">normally and this is kind of surprising</text><text start="1549.679" dur="3.561">because the light that&amp;#39;s coming into</text><text

is</text><text start="1556.88" dur="4.2">it compensates for this and it takes</text><text start="1559.08" dur="4.479">into account the ambient Lighting in</text><text start="1561.08" dur="5.24">figuring out what color something should</text><text start="1563.559" dur="4.561">be and indoor lighting is relatively</text><text start="1566.32" dur="3.8">yellowish normally and Outdoor Lighting</text><text start="1568.12" dur="4.919">is relatively bluish even if it&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="1570.12" dur="4.559">cloudy day so it&amp;#39;s always actively</text><text start="1573.039" dur="4.281">compensating for this surrounding light</text><text start="1574.679" dur="5.161">and this photo of a dress was just so</text><text start="1577.32" dur="3.8">happened that it was fully ambiguous</text><text start="1579.84" dur="4.28">with respect to what the ambient</text><text start="1581.12" dur="4.679">lighting might be there&amp;#39;s very little</text><text start="1584.12" dur="4.2">context if you look back at it it&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="1585.799" dur="5.321">dress fills almost the whole image and</text><text start="1588.32" dur="5.32">so some people&amp;#39;s brains assume that it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1591.12" dur="4.2">taken indoors that&amp;#39;s great and others</text><text start="1593.64" dur="3.24">assume that it was taken out

you say it&amp;#39;s a theory but the</text><text start="1605.799" dur="5.12">one that I find the most stunning of</text><text start="1607.88" dur="5.48">these is from work by a psychologist</text><text start="1610.919" dur="4.201">named Dan Simons so I experienced it</text><text start="1613.36" dur="4.28">myself I&amp;#39;ll try to tell a little story</text><text start="1615.12" dur="5.559">briefly I was at a talk that someone was</text><text start="1617.64" dur="5.96">giving uh actually scientist good</text><text start="1620.679" dur="4.88">science writer too named Mario Olio and</text><text start="1623.6" dur="4.079">so he gave this talk to a big filled</text><text start="1625.559" dur="5.36">Auditorium and he said I&amp;#39;m going to show</text><text start="1627.679" dur="5.36">you all a video and it will be players</text><text start="1630.919" dur="3.841">handing a basketball back and forth</text><text start="1633.039" dur="3.36">among them in a very confusing way and</text><text start="1634.76" dur="4.24">they&amp;#39;re moving around in complicated</text><text start="1636.399" dur="4.64">ways and some of them are wearing black</text><text start="1639" dur="4.6">uniforms and some are wearing white</text><text start="1641.039" dur="4.441">uniforms and I want you to just</text><text start="1643.6" dur="3.12">concentrate now I&amp;#39;m trying to remember</text><text start="1645.48" dur="3.079">does he say just concentrate on the</text><text start="1646.72" dur="2.76">players with the black uniforms that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1648.559" dur="2.6">right and there are actually two</text><text start="1649.48" dur="3.64">basketballs going around so the people</text><text start="1651.159" dur="3.961">dressed in black have one ball and they</text><text start="1653.12" dur="4.2">pass it to each other the people dressed</text><text start="1655.12" dur="4">in white have another basketball and</text><text start="1657.32" dur="3.12">they pass around to each other and as</text><text start="1659.12" dur="3.439">you say they&amp;#39;re all sort of wandering</text><text start="1660.44" dur="3.44">around in in complex patterns you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1662.559" dur="3.921">asked to focus only on the people</text><text start="1663.88" dur="4.48">dressed in white and count the number of</text><text start="1666.48" dur="3.4">passes they make among each other and</text><text start="1668.36" dur="3.24">just you know don&amp;#39;t worry about the</text><text start="1669.88" dur="3.76">people dressed in black so and just to</text><text start="1671.6" dur="4.72">give one further bit of detail from the</text><text start="1673.64" dur="5">experience as I experienced it that day</text><text start="1676.32" dur="4.04">the person presenting said you you may</text><text start="1678.64" dur="4.68">hear while you&amp;#39;re doing the counting</text><text start="1680.36" dur="5">task some people laughing and don&amp;#39;t get</text><text start="1683.32" dur="4.359">distracted by that it&amp;#39;s a complicated</text><text start="1685.36" dur="4.48">task and just concentrate and be sure to</text><text start="1687.679" dur="4.561">carefully count the passes among the</text><text start="1689.84" dur="4.76">players with the white uniforms so and I</text><text start="1692.24" dur="4.319">did that I did what I was told as did</text><text start="1694.6" dur="6.24">everybody else and I&amp;#39;ll let you take it</text><text start="1696.559" dur="6.72">from there so people do this and when</text><text start="1700.84" dur="4.079">the video stops you typically go around</text><text start="1703.279" dur="3.921">it and you say okay so how many passes</text><text start="1704.919" dur="4.6">were there and people come up with</text><text start="1707.2" dur="3.959">numbers and sometimes they get it right</text><text start="1709.519" dur="3.561">sometimes they get it wrong it&amp;#39;s quite</text><text start="1711.159" dur="3.721">challenging and then I you know I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1713.08" dur="3.4">know whether to give away the

start="1719.84" dur="5.199">what I would suggest is is not telling</text><text start="1722.32" dur="6.4">actually what happened but the basic</text><text start="1725.039" dur="6.601">idea is that we have this impression</text><text start="1728.72" dur="4.6">that we really just see what&amp;#39;s out there</text><text start="1731.64" dur="4.279">especially if we&amp;#39;re looking straight

dur="8.281">BL kindness and it shows how that&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="1741.039" dur="7.24">not true how what we experience can be</text><text start="1746.08" dur="5.479">quite different from what&amp;#39;s actually out</text><text start="1748.279" dur="4.88">there in a way that can be quite amusing</text><text start="1751.559" dur="4.281">to people especially if they know

applies to other domains</text><text start="1775.44" dur="5.719">as well if something is changing very</text><text start="1778.96" dur="4.24">slowly and we&amp;#39;re focusing on something</text><text

dur="5.52">hold on a minute I did not see the sign</text><text start="1862.2" dur="5.319">and of course I decided that I would</text><text start="1864.36" dur="5.24">challenge this ticket on the basis of</text><text start="1867.519" dur="4.801">the phenomenon of change blindness</text><text start="1869.6" dur="4.88">because to get out of a ticket like that</text><text start="1872.32" dur="4.079">you can say you can argue that the sign</text><text start="1874.48" dur="4.52">was not visible and if the sign isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1876.399" dur="5.64">visible then you&amp;#39;re not responsible for</text><text start="1879" dur="6.519">not adhering to it so my argument was</text><text start="1882.039" dur="6.88">that well yes indeed the sign was within</text><text start="1885.519" dur="5.88">my ey line but because of change</text><text start="1888.919" dur="4.72">blindness I was not expecting the sign</text><text start="1891.399" dur="3.721">to be there it had changed when I wasn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="1893.639" dur="4.121">there nobody put it up while I was</text><text start="1895.12" dur="5.519">looking you know I literally did not</text><text start="1897.76" dur="5.24">perceive it so if I didn&amp;#39;t experience it</text><text start="1900.639" dur="5.52">then I can&amp;#39;t be held responsible for</text><text start="1903" dur="6.36">making that no left turn and what what</text><text start="1906.159" dur="5.281">did the judge say and but I leave you</text><text start="1909.36" dur="5.279">into it did drag on because I wrote a</text><text start="1911.44" dur="5.4">written deposition and then that was</text><text start="1914.639" dur="4.481">rejected and then in California you can</text><text start="1916.84" dur="4.16">eventually you can go to tra court and I</text><text start="1919.12" dur="5.08">thought I&amp;#39;m going to traffic court and</text><text start="1921" dur="4.919">so I had my day in court and I prepared</text><text start="1924.2" dur="3.479">this little PowerPoint presentation</text><text start="1925.919" dur="3.561">about change blindness and had photos I</text><text start="1927.679" dur="3.161">mean this sounds insane now looking back</text><text start="1929.48" dur="4.559">I mean I must have had more useful</text><text start="1930.84" dur="5.4">things to do and of course it turns out</text><text start="1934.039" dur="3.841">all that mattered was whether the cop</text><text start="1936.24" dur="4.36">who&amp;#39;d given you the ticket showed up or</text><text start="1937.88" dur="5.32">not if the cop didn&amp;#39;t show up then</text><text start="1940.6" dur="5.799">basically you got let off and if the cop</text><text start="1943.2" dur="5.319">did show up then your ticket was upheld</text><text start="1946.399" dur="4.64">and what whatever clever defend that you</text><text start="1948.519" dur="5.12">had was really not that relevant so it</text><text start="1951.039" dur="4.041">was it was a bit sobering but you know I</text><text start="1953.639" dur="2.92">still I still think it was a valid</text><text start="1955.08" dur="5">defense I still think that&amp;#39;s what</text><text start="1956.559" dur="5.84">happened H well all right so as we move</text><text start="1960.08" dur="3.88">towards the end of our discussion here I</text><text start="1962.399" dur="4.24">think we should start talking about the</text><text start="1963.96" dur="4.4">self I&amp;#39;m reminded of Expressions that</text><text start="1966.639" dur="3.88">you have been using earlier in this</text><text start="1968.36" dur="5">conversation where you say things like</text><text start="1970.519" dur="5.361">the brain&amp;#39;s best guess or the brain is</text><text start="1973.36" dur="4.12">trying to make sense of it almost makes</text><text start="1975.88" dur="3.919">me picture of what people used to call</text><text start="1977.48" dur="4.319">the ulous like there&amp;#39;s a little person</text><text start="1979.799" dur="3.48">inside your head who&amp;#39;s looking out</text><text start="1981.799" dur="4">through your eyes trying to make sense</text><text start="1983.279" dur="4.52">of the world it&amp;#39;s sort of the self what</text><text start="1985.799" dur="4.081">is it I mean who&amp;#39;s in there who is it</text><text start="1987.799" dur="4.6">that&amp;#39;s trying to make sense yeah I mean</text><text start="1989.88" dur="4.399">so this is why when I say the brain</text><text start="1992.399" dur="4.201">believes this or the brain predicts this</text><text start="1994.279" dur="4.921">I I&amp;#39;m try to be careful to say the brain</text><text start="1996.6" dur="4.88">rather than you because I think the</text><text start="1999.2" dur="4.76">experience of being you the experience</text><text start="2001.48" dur="4.199">of self is another

start="2008.44" dur="4.92">another challenge to this naive how</text><text start="2011.12" dur="4.08">things seem view of perception know just</text><text start="2013.36" dur="3.76">as it seems as though there&amp;#39;s a real</text><text start="2015.2" dur="5.92">world out there that just pours itself</text><text start="2017.12" dur="6.36">into our minds it might also seem to us</text><text start="2021.12" dur="5.559">that the self is the thing that does the</text><text start="2023.48" dur="6.88">perceiving this quiddity this essence of</text><text start="2026.679" dur="6.36">you or me maybe the soul that resides</text><text start="2030.36" dur="5.24">somewhere homunculus like inside the</text><text start="2033.039" dur="4.161">skull doing all the perceiving and then</text><text start="2035.6" dur="3.799">deciding what to do and you pulling</text><text start="2037.2" dur="6.24">various strings in the body to make</text><text start="2039.399" dur="6.441">actions happen and you I think this is</text><text start="2043.44" dur="4.04">fundamentally mistaken and again this is</text><text start="2045.84" dur="3.4">not a new thing to say here the</text><text start="2047.48" dur="3.639">philosopher David Hume Scottish</text><text start="2049.24" dur="4.2">philosopher had what he called the</text><text start="2051.119" dur="4.681">bundle theory of self which is the idea</text><text start="2053.44" dur="5.28">that the nature of self is just an</text><text start="2055.8" dur="5.44">ongoing collection of perceptions it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2058.72" dur="5.399">not the thing that does the perceiving</text><text start="2061.24" dur="6.2">it&amp;#39;s another kind of perception but this</text><text start="2064.119" dur="5.681">time based at least in part on the body</text><text start="2067.44" dur="4.679">so just as the brain in trying to make</text><text start="2069.8" dur="5.039">sense of what&amp;#39;s out there in the world</text><text start="2072.119" dur="4.48">is making predictions about the causes</text><text start="2074.839" dur="4.921">of signals that come into the eyes and</text><text start="2076.599" dur="5.201">the ears and so on it&amp;#39;s also trying to</text><text start="2079.76" dur="5">figure out what&amp;#39;s happening inside the</text><text start="2081.8" dur="6.16">body and trying to also control the body</text><text start="2084.76" dur="5.639">too and this also happens in my view</text><text start="2087.96" dur="4.439">anyway through a process of the brain</text><text start="2090.399" dur="4.321">creating predictions and using them to</text><text start="2092.399" dur="5.481">update sensory signals but in this case</text><text start="2094.72" dur="4.68">from the body or when making actions to</text><text start="2097.88" dur="3.28">predictions to actually you know</text><text start="2099.4" dur="4">overwhelm sensory data so they become</text><text start="2101.16" dur="4.52">self-fulfilling predictions so that if I</text><text start="2103.4" dur="3.76">move my arm to pick up the cup again you</text><text start="2105.68" dur="4.679">know that&amp;#39;s a kind of self-fulfilling</text><text start="2107.16" dur="5.28">prediction about where my arm will be</text><text start="2110.359" dur="4.521">but the key point is that there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="2112.44" dur="5.159">common principle here underlying</text><text start="2114.88" dur="5.4">experiences of the world and experiences</text><text start="2117.599" dur="5.52">of the self they&amp;#39;re both forms of</text><text start="2120.28" dur="6.799">perceptual prediction neither of them</text><text start="2123.119" dur="6.681">reflect things as they really are and</text><text

kind of taking this idea</text><text start="2135.359" dur="3.161">that we build up about how our</text><text start="2136.92" dur="5">perception of the world works and then</text><text start="2138.52" dur="8.04">turning the lens inwards to understand</text><text start="2141.92" dur="7.199">how the same core principle can explain</text><text start="2146.56" dur="4.44">experiences of selfhood and

direction</text><text start="2233.44" dur="3.48">research is going and so I would like to</text><text start="2235.44" dur="3.48">talk to you about the sorts of studies</text><text start="2236.92" dur="4.919">you&amp;#39;re doing with your group you and</text><text start="2238.92" dur="5.12">your lab right now on perceptions what</text><text start="2241.839" dur="4.801">you&amp;#39;re calling the perception census</text><text start="2244.04" dur="4.36">yeah thank you yeah we doing a few I</text><text start="2246.64" dur="3.32">think really fun things at the moment</text><text start="2248.4" dur="3.24">okay before I mention the perception</text><text start="2249.96" dur="4.159">sensus I just wanted to mention one</text><text start="2251.64" dur="4.08">thing we&amp;#39;re working on which I think is</text><text start="2254.119" dur="3.841">maybe interesting to you too because</text><text start="2255.72" dur="4.08">it&amp;#39;s all about emergence which I know is</text><text start="2257.96" dur="5.04">a topic that you&amp;#39;ve written some great</text><text start="2259.8" dur="5.4">stuff about know emergence is often</text><text start="2263" dur="4.48">imbued with slightly spooky properties</text><text start="2265.2" dur="4.44">like there&amp;#39;s the hole that has something</text><text start="2267.48" dur="4">that the parts don&amp;#39;t have and there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2269.64" dur="5.08">this sort of idea that conscious</text><text start="2271.48" dur="5.44">experiences emerge from neural activity</text><text start="2274.72" dur="4.68">in some way and that can either be in a</text><text start="2276.92" dur="4.8">spooky way where you say there&amp;#39;s at some</text><text start="2279.4" dur="3.88">point this new thing comes into</text><text start="2281.72" dur="4.08">existence which is consciousness which</text><text start="2283.28" dur="5.039">wasn&amp;#39;t there or you can attack it in a</text><text start="2285.8" dur="5.2">more pragmatic way much as we might try</text><text start="2288.319" dur="4.321">to explain how flocks of birds have</text><text start="2291" dur="4.079">flockin you know there&amp;#39;s something about</text><text start="2292.64" dur="3.8">a flock of starings as happens in</text><text start="2295.079" dur="3.24">Brighton in the winter actually these</text><text start="2296.44" dur="4.56">starings they Roost on the pier every</text><text start="2298.319" dur="5.241">evening and the flock seems to have an</text><text start="2301" dur="4.56">existence an autonomy of its own that</text><text start="2303.56" dur="3.559">the individual starlings do not and</text><text start="2305.56" dur="4.12">there&amp;#39;s nothing spooky or mysterious</text><text start="2307.119" dur="5">about that but there&amp;#39;s a challenge in in</text><text start="2309.68" dur="4.96">using mathematics to capture that</text><text start="2312.119" dur="5.081">relationship to capture the flock of a</text><text start="2314.64" dur="4.32">flock so this is one line of research</text><text start="2317.2" dur="4.399">that we&amp;#39;re pushing quite hard on now how</text><text start="2318.96" dur="5.76">can we develop these kinds of measures</text><text start="2321.599" dur="5.361">and apply them to neural Dynamics to the</text><text start="2324.72" dur="4.2">activities of neurons to say are</text><text start="2326.96" dur="4.92">conscious States associated with the</text><text start="2328.92" dur="5.64">sort of flock of neural activity if you</text><text start="2331.88" dur="3.84">like and what kind of flock and so this</text><text start="2334.56" dur="2.48">is something we&amp;#39;re doing I think it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2335.72" dur="3.8">it&amp;#39;s really fun because it for me it</text><text start="2337.04" dur="4.279">hits the one Bullseye of philosophy</text><text start="2339.52"

start="2362.04" dur="4.12">other&amp;#39;s very different the other is this</text><text start="2363.72" dur="4.56">idea it&amp;#39;s really following on from our</text><text start="2366.16" dur="4.679">conversation about perception and</text><text start="2368.28" dur="5.36">especially the dress so remember the</text><text start="2370.839" dur="5.921">dress of course was this one example</text><text start="2373.64" dur="4.52">where it suddenly became very clear that</text><text start="2376.76" dur="4.319">people can have very different</text><text start="2378.16" dur="6.8">experiences even for the same thing in</text><text start="2381.079" dur="6.201">this case this photo the mistake to make</text><text start="2384.96" dur="5">is to assume that if it&amp;#39;s not some weird</text><text start="2387.28" dur="5.319">situation like the dress then we all</text><text start="2389.96" dur="4.08">experience the world in the same way and</text><text start="2392.599" dur="3.641">we don&amp;#39;t I mean there&amp;#39;s a very old</text><text start="2394.04" dur="4">concept called neurodiversity well old I</text><text start="2396.24" dur="4.28">mean back to the &amp;#39;90s</text><text start="2398.04" dur="4.48">and it also makes the point that just as</text><text start="2400.52" dur="3.92">we all differ on the outside in skin</text><text start="2402.52" dur="3.48">color and height and so on now we all</text><text start="2404.44" dur="3.28">have different brains at least a little</text><text start="2406" dur="4.599">bit so we&amp;#39;re likely to differ on the</text><text start="2407.72" dur="5.48">inside too the term neurodiversity</text><text start="2410.599" dur="5.041">though has tended to become associated</text><text start="2413.2"
