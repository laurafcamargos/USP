dur="4.08">from ships of the seas because captains</text><text start="240.56" dur="4.08">and porter masters when in the vast</text><text start="242.72" dur="3.68">featureless nothing could still count

dur="4.32">any airport the runway is already</text><text start="266.96" dur="4.72">aligned with navigational numbers</text><text start="268.88" dur="5.12">begging to be used but before grabbing</text><text start="271.68" dur="3.92">the obvious one again ponder for a</text><text start="274" dur="4.32">moment the runway points from the</text><text start="275.6" dur="5.12">perspective of the port toward the plane</text><text start="278.32" dur="4.24">the rather more important heading to use</text><text start="280.72" dur="4.08">is from the plane&amp;#39;s perspective</text><text start="282.56" dur="4.8">approaching the port which on the plan</text><text start="284.8" dur="4.959">is at the opposite end actually because</text><text start="287.36" dur="4.16">it&amp;#39;s what number matches the compass in</text><text start="289.759" dur="3.361">the cockpit that&amp;#39;s critical all right</text><text start="291.52" dur="3.679">this needs a couple of example airports</text><text start="293.12" dur="4.079">take one with a north south runway when</text><text start="295.199" dur="3.841">the wind blows from the north to the</text><text start="297.199" dur="4.081">south the tower directs pilots to</text><text start="299.04" dur="4.159">approach from the south meaning they</text><text start="301.28" dur="4.96">need to point the plane north which on</text><text start="303.199" dur="5.521">their compass is a heading of 360° so</text><text start="306.24" dur="4.32">let&amp;#39;s put a big 360 on that end for now</text><text start="308.72" dur="4.56">when the winds reverse the tower directs</text><text start="310.56" dur="5.28">pilots to approach from the north to fly</text><text start="313.28" dur="4.479">south which reads 180 so let&amp;#39;s put a big</text><text start="315.84" dur="3.359">180 on that end as well now that we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="317.759" dur="3.521">got our heading numbers the convention</text><text start="319.199" dur="4.161">is to round them to 10 and cut off the</text><text start="321.28" dur="3.919">zero for the runway number because we</text><text start="323.36" dur="4.24">don&amp;#39;t need three sigfigs of precision</text><text start="325.199" dur="5.041">when airports have singledigit numbers</text><text start="327.6" dur="4.8">of runways and the very stressed air</text><text start="330.24" dur="4.48">traffic controllers in the tower need to</text><text start="332.4" dur="4.88">repeat precisely these numbers hundreds</text><text start="334.72" dur="4.56">of times a day so saving syllables here</text><text start="337.28" dur="4.32">really matters thus when the tower tells</text><text start="339.28" dur="4.08">the plane to use runway 36 the pilot</text><text start="341.6" dur="4.24">knows they need to get south of the</text><text start="343.36" dur="4.88">airport to land facing north and while</text><text start="345.84" dur="4.32">there are like a million indicators in a</text><text start="348.24" dur="4.56">cockpit the pilot can always confirm</text><text start="350.16" dur="5.12">they&amp;#39;re doing it right by reading 360 on</text><text start="352.8" dur="4.399">their ancient ancestors compass this low</text><text start="355.28" dur="4.08">tech check is useful as a fallback</text><text start="357.199" dur="4.72">because a compass can see the way even</text><text start="359.36" dur="4.64">when eyes and other equipment cannot as</text><text start="361.919" dur="3.84">a two runway example an airport with a</text><text start="364" dur="4.56">perfect ordinal X would get numbered</text><text start="365.759" dur="4.241">thusly northwest to southeast gives 315</text><text start="368.56" dur="3.68">for one end because that&amp;#39;s the way the</text><text start="370" dur="5.199">pilot needs to point and 135 at the</text><text start="372.24" dur="6.079">other round to 10 for 320 and 140 then</text><text start="375.199" dur="6.161">drop the zeros to get runways 32 and 14</text><text start="378.319" dur="5.921">on the other side 225 and 45 round to 10</text><text start="381.36" dur="4.559">again drop the zeros for 23 and five now</text><text start="384.24" dur="4.88">when the towers talk to the pilots they</text><text start="385.919" dur="5.201">say each digit individually so runway 23</text><text start="389.12" dur="4.639">because clarity here is critical which</text><text start="391.12" dur="5.12">is also why the font and exact size of</text><text start="393.759" dur="4.241">these digits is standardized worldwide</text><text start="396.24" dur="4.48">though there are disagreements between</text><text start="398" dur="4.8">the abundant aviation agencies as to if</text><text start="400.72" dur="4.16">singledigit runways like six should have</text><text start="402.8" dur="3.76">a leading zero for clarity or if that</text><text start="404.88" dur="3.599">leading zero should only be in our</text><text start="406.56" dur="3.6">hearts which it shouldn&amp;#39;t be anyway</text><text start="408.479" dur="3.681">that&amp;#39;s the surprisingly good system</text><text start="410.16"

though</text><text start="416.4" dur="4.4">there are a couple of wrinkles for think</text><text start="418.8" dur="4.239">about it if the wind mostly blows back</text><text start="420.8" dur="4.32">and forth in most places then most big</text><text start="423.039" dur="4.641">busy urban international airports will</text><text start="425.12" dur="4.88">need multiple runways in parallel but</text><text start="427.68" dur="4.4">parallel runways have the same heading</text><text start="430" dur="4.8">thus the same number under this system</text><text start="432.08" dur="4.959">which would be unclear for pilots to say</text><text start="434.8" dur="4.239">the least so all the agencies assembled</text><text start="437.039" dur="3.761">to agree if you have two parallel</text><text start="439.039" dur="4.88">runways they will have the same number</text><text start="440.8" dur="5.2">but add an L or an R for left and right</text><text start="443.919" dur="4.641">if you need to construct a third runway</text><text start="446" dur="4.24">add a C for center 2 but with four or</text><text start="448.56" dur="4.16">more two runways will get the correct</text><text start="450.24"

video inside this</text><text start="668.64" dur="4.879">geography video and it&amp;#39;s called magnets</text><text start="671.36" dur="3.919">what&amp;#39;s your deal okay we really can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="673.519" dur="5.201">cover everything about magnets because</text><text start="675.279" dur="5.441">it&amp;#39;s just so much but some bits of some</text><text start="678.72" dur="4.88">metals such as iron generate around them</text><text start="680.72" dur="4.48">a magnetic field why and how were a</text><text start="683.6" dur="3.04">mystery for a long time until we</text><text start="685.2" dur="3.04">discovered that if you take a wire and</text><text start="686.64" dur="3.68">run a current of electrons through it</text><text start="688.24" dur="4.08">aka electricity this current also</text><text start="690.32" dur="4.48">generates a magnetic field around the</text><text start="692.32" dur="4.4">wire but weirder if you start with a</text><text start="694.8" dur="4.24">current of electrons and pop them in a</text><text start="696.72" dur="4.799">magnetic field the current will curve</text><text start="699.04" dur="4.479">and oh look you&amp;#39;ve stumbled upon a clue</text><text start="701.519" dur="4.721">to one of the fundamental secrets of the</text><text start="703.519" dur="4.601">universe magnets and electricity are two</text><text start="706.24" dur="3.92">expressions of the same thing</text><text start="708.12" dur="3.959">electromagnetism that&amp;#39;s why in science</text><text start="710.16" dur="3.6">class you can coil up a wire send a</text><text start="712.079" dur="3.841">current of electricity through it and</text><text start="713.76" dur="4">the whole thing becomes a magnet one you</text><text start="715.92" dur="4.64">can make stronger and stronger with each</text><text start="717.76" dur="4.72">additional coil cuz curving currents are</text><text start="720.56" dur="4.399">magnets which is why when you cut the</text><text start="722.48" dur="4.56">current everything drops our just iron</text><text start="724.959" dur="5.041">magnets are doing the same thing but you</text><text start="727.04" dur="5.68">need to zoom down and down and down and</text><text start="730" dur="5.04">down to the atomic level to see here an</text><text start="732.72" dur="5.119">atom of iron has a cloud of electrons</text><text start="735.04" dur="5.52">each electron with a charge and as they</text><text start="737.839" dur="5.361">whirl around they create a tiny current</text><text start="740.56" dur="5.76">and a tiny magnetic field zooming even</text><text start="743.2" dur="5.12">closer each electron spins and this spin</text><text start="746.32" dur="4.48">acts like the universe&amp;#39;s teeniest</text><text start="748.32" dur="5.12">tiniest current creating the teeniest</text><text start="750.8" dur="5.039">tiniest electromagnet okay look whirl</text><text start="753.44" dur="4.72">around and spin don&amp;#39;t mean what you</text><text start="755.839" dur="6">think down here because in the land of</text><text start="758.16" dur="6.479">quantum words mean nothing there is only</text><text start="761.839" dur="4.8">math that we&amp;#39;re not going to do so just</text><text start="764.639" dur="3.921">go with it anyway in most atoms all</text><text start="766.639" dur="3.601">these current created tiny magnetic</text><text start="768.56" dur="3.839">fields arrange themselves against</text><text start="770.24" dur="4.56">themselves so it all cancels out to</text><text start="772.399" dur="4.161">nothing but in a rare few atoms like</text><text start="774.8" dur="3.92">iron does there happen to be an</text><text start="776.56" dur="4.959">imbalance that aligns and adds up and</text><text start="778.72" dur="4.96">thus each iron atom is a tiny magnet and</text><text start="781.519" dur="4.641">if adjacent atoms align their little</text><text start="783.68" dur="5.279">magnetic fields add up and zooming out</text><text start="786.16" dur="5.44">and out and out if all the atoms in the</text><text start="788.959" dur="5.44">iron are aligned then the iron acts as</text><text start="791.6" dur="4.88">one big monkeysized magnet but deep down</text><text start="794.399" dur="4.481">inside it&amp;#39;s just electron-sized</text><text start="796.48" dur="4.4">electromagnets and scaling up and up and</text><text start="798.88" dur="4.24">up and up to the whole Earth&amp;#39;s magnetic</text><text start="800.88" dur="4.639">field it&amp;#39;s an electromagnet all over</text><text start="803.12" dur="4.48">again see the Earth is made of parts the</text><text start="805.519" dur="4.32">thin perilous cool crust on which we</text><text start="807.6" dur="4.56">live the inner solid core that is</text><text start="809.839" dur="4.321">several thousands of degrees hot a</text><text

dur="5.599">circles so do all its electrons curving</text><text start="839.76" dur="5.28">currents which gets us magnetic fields</text><text start="842.079" dur="4.88">baby though as individual coils
