you</text><text start="50.64" dur="4.28">end up with is what&amp;#39;s called a</text><text start="52.6" dur="4.72">cryptocurrency you see Bitcoin is just</text><text start="54.92" dur="4.52">the

minutes we&amp;#39;re going to begin the</text><text start="151.72" dur="3.64">story with something more down toe</text><text start="153.599" dur="3.64">ledgers and digital</text><text start="155.36" dur="3.68">signatures if you and your friends</text><text start="157.239" dur="3.241">exchange money pretty frequently you</text><text start="159.04" dur="3.76">know paying your share of the dinner</text><text start="160.48" dur="4.6">Bill and such it can be inconvenient to</text><text start="162.8" dur="4.28">exchange cash all the time so you might</text><text start="165.08" dur="3.879">keep a communal Ledger that records all</text><text start="167.08" dur="4.079">of the payments that you intend to make</text><text start="168.959" dur="5.441">some point in the future you know Alice</text><text start="171.159" dur="5.321">pays Bob $20 Bob pays Charlie $40 things</text><text start="174.4" dur="3.68">like that this Ledger is going to be</text><text start="176.48" dur="3.92">something public and accessible to</text><text start="178.08" dur="5">everyone like a website where anyone can</text><text start="180.4" dur="4.28">go and just add new lines and let&amp;#39;s say</text><text start="183.08" dur="3.079">that at the end of every month you all</text><text start="184.68" dur="4.24">good together look at the list of</text><text start="186.159" dur="4.201">transactions and settle up if you spent</text><text start="188.92" dur="3.36">more than you received you put that</text><text start="190.36" dur="4">money in the pot and if you received</text><text start="192.28" dur="4.8">more than you spent you take that money</text><text start="194.36" dur="4.68">out so the protocol for being part of</text><text start="197.08" dur="4.96">this very simple system might look like</text><text start="199.04" dur="4.88">this anyone can add lines to The Ledger</text><text start="202.04" dur="4.68">and at the end of every month you all</text><text start="203.92" dur="5.16">get together and settle up now one</text><text start="206.72" dur="4.799">problem with a public Ledger like this</text><text start="209.08" dur="4.519">is that any one can add a line so what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="211.519" dur="5.161">to prevent Bob from going and writing</text><text start="213.599" dur="5.681">Alice pays Bob $100 without Alice</text><text start="216.68" dur="5.04">approving how are we supposed to trust</text><text start="219.28" dur="4.44">that all of these transactions are what</text><text start="221.72" dur="4.2">the sender meant them to</text><text start="223.72" dur="4.719">be well this is where the first bit of</text><text start="225.92" dur="5.08">cryptography comes in digital</text><text start="228.439" dur="4.401">signatures like handwritten signatures</text><text start="231" dur="3.76">the idea here is that Alice should be</text><text start="232.84" dur="4">able to add something next to that</text><text start="234.76" dur="4.36">transaction that proves that she has</text><text start="236.84" dur="4.44">seen it and that she&amp;#39;s approved of it</text><text start="239.12" dur="4.24">and it should be infeasible for anyone</text><text start="241.28" dur="4.959">else to forge that</text><text start="243.36" dur="4.84">signature at first it might seem like a</text><text start="246.239" dur="4.64">digital signature shouldn&amp;#39;t even be</text><text start="248.2" dur="4.599">possible I mean whatever data makes up</text><text start="250.879" dur="4.401">that signature can just be read and</text><text start="252.799" dur="3.44">copied by a computer so how do you</text><text start="255.28" dur="3.04">prevent</text><text start="256.239" dur="3.801">forgeries well the way this works is</text><text start="258.32" dur="4.159">that everyone generates what&amp;#39;s called a</text><text start="260.04" dur="4.84">public key private key pair Each of</text><text start="262.479" dur="4.041">which looks like some string of bits the</text><text start="264.88" dur="3.599">private key is sometimes also called a</text><text start="266.52" dur="4.2">secret key so that we can abbreviate it</text><text start="268.479" dur="5.321">as SK while abbreviating the public key</text><text start="270.72" dur="4.6">is PK now as the name suggests this</text><text start="273.8" dur="4.48">secret key it&amp;#39;s something you want to</text><text start="275.32" dur="4.96">keep to yourself in the real world your</text><text start="278.28" dur="4.199">handwritten signature looks the same no</text><text start="280.28" dur="4">matter what document you&amp;#39;re signing but</text><text start="282.479" dur="3.681">a digital signature is actually much</text><text start="284.28" dur="4.479">stronger because it changes for</text><text start="286.16" dur="4.64">different messages it looks like some</text><text start="288.759" dur="5.361">string of ones and zeros commonly</text><text start="290.8" dur="6.04">something like 256 bits and altering the</text><text start="294.12" dur="4.56">message even slightly completely changes</text><text start="296.84" dur="4">what the signature on that message</text><text start="298.68" dur="4.04">should look like</text><text start="300.84" dur="3.799">speaking a little more formally</text><text start="302.72" dur="3.759">producing a signature involves a</text><text start="304.639" dur="4.56">function that depends both on the</text><text start="306.479" dur="4.641">message itself and on your private key</text><text start="309.199" dur="4.201">the private key ensures that only you</text><text start="311.12" dur="4.28">can produce that signature and the fact</text><text start="313.4" dur="3.799">that it depends on the message means</text><text start="315.4" dur="4.639">that no one can just copy one of your</text><text start="317.199" dur="5.601">signatures and then Forge it on another</text><text start="320.039" dur="4.88">message hand inand with this is a second</text><text start="322.8" dur="4.399">function used to verify that a signature</text><text start="324.919" dur="5.041">is valid and this is where the public</text><text start="327.199" dur="5.081">key comes into play all it does is</text><text start="329.96" dur="4.239">output true or false to indicate if this</text><text start="332.28" dur="4.08">was a signature produced by the private</text><text start="334.199" dur="4.761">key associated with the public key that</text><text start="336.36" dur="4.6">you&amp;#39;re using for verification I won&amp;#39;t go</text><text start="338.96" dur="4.359">into the details of how exactly both</text><text start="340.96" dur="4.56">these functions work but the idea is</text><text start="343.319" dur="4.801">that it should be completely infeasible</text><text start="345.52" dur="5.6">to find a valid signature if you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="348.12" dur="4.88">know the secret key specifically there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="351.12" dur="4.079">no strategy better than just guessing</text><text start="353" dur="4.039">and checking random signatures which you</text><text start="355.199" dur="2.761">can check using the public key that</text><text start="357.039" dur="3">everyone</text><text start="357.96" dur="3.88">knows now think about how many</text><text start="360.039" dur="6.321">signatures there are with a length of</text><text start="361.84" dur="8.16">256 bits that&amp;#39;s 2 to the power of</text><text start="366.36" dur="5.32">256 this is a stupidly large number to</text><text start="370" dur="4.319">call it astronomically large would be</text><text start="371.68" dur="4.6">giving way too much credit to astronomy</text><text start="374.319" dur="4.521">in fact I made a supplemental video</text><text start="376.28" dur="5.359">devoted just to illustrating what a huge</text><text start="378.84" dur="4.759">number this is right here let&amp;#39;s just say</text><text start="381.639" dur="4.441">that when you verified that a signature</text><text start="383.599" dur="5.121">against a given message is valid you can</text><text start="386.08" dur="4.6">feel extremely confident that the only</text><text start="388.72" dur="4.199">way someone could have produced it is if</text><text start="390.68" dur="5.28">they knew the secret key associated with</text><text start="392.919" dur="5.081">the public key you used for</text><text start="395.96" dur="4.16">verification now making sure that people</text><text start="398" dur="3.759">sign transactions on The Ledger is</text><text start="400.12" dur="4.199">pretty good but there&amp;#39;s one slight</text><text start="401.759" dur="4.121">loophole if Alice signs a transaction</text><text start="404.319" dur="4.481">like Alice pays Bob</text><text start="405.88" dur="5.48">$100 even though Bob can&amp;#39;t forge Alice&amp;#39;s</text><text start="408.8" dur="4.48">signature on a new message he could just</text><text start="411.36" dur="4.36">copy that same line as many times as he</text><text start="413.28" dur="5.24">wants I mean that message signature</text><text start="415.72" dur="4.52">combination remains valid to get around</text><text start="418.52" dur="4.119">this what we do is make it so that when</text><text start="420.24" dur="5.04">you sign a transaction the message has</text><text start="422.639" dur="4.28">to also include some sort of unique ID</text><text start="425.28" dur="4">associated with that</text><text start="426.919" dur="5.481">transaction that way if Alice pays Bob</text><text start="429.28" dur="4.759">$100 multiple times each one of those</text><text start="432.4" dur="3.519">lines on the Ledger requires a</text><text start="434.039" dur="4.401">completely new</text><text start="435.919" dur="4.801">signature all right great digital</text><text start="438.44" dur="5.039">signatures remove a huge aspect of trust</text><text start="440.72" dur="4.52">in this initial protocol but even still</text><text start="443.479" dur="4.201">if you were to really do this you would</text><text start="445.24" dur="3.84">be relying on an honor System of sorts</text><text start="447.68" dur="3.16">namely you&amp;#39;re trusting that everyone</text><text start="449.08" dur="4.679">will actually follow through and settle</text><text start="450.84" dur="5.12">up in cash at the end of each month what</text><text start="453.759" dur="4.321">if for example Charlie racks up</text><text start="455.96" dur="5.32">thousands of dollars in debt and just</text><text start="458.08" dur="5.36">refuses to show up the only real reason</text><text start="461.28" dur="4.759">to revert back to cash to settle up is</text><text start="463.44" dur="5.479">if some people I&amp;#39;m looking at you Charly</text><text start="466.039" dur="4.801">owe a lot of money so maybe you have the</text><text start="468.919" dur="4.28">clever idea that you never actually have</text><text start="470.84" dur="4.199">to settle up in cash as long as you have</text><text start="473.199" dur="4.44">some way to prevent people from spending</text><text start="475.039" dur="4.521">too much more than they take in maybe</text><text start="477.639" dur="4.441">what you do is start by having everyone</text><text start="479.56" dur="4.8">pay $100 into the pot and then have the</text><text start="482.08" dur="5.04">first few lines of The Ledger read Alice</text><text start="484.36" dur="3.92">gets $100 Bob gets $100 Charlie gets</text><text start="487.12" dur="4.519">$100</text><text start="488.28" dur="5.319">Etc now just don&amp;#39;t accept any</text><text start="491.639" dur="4.12">transactions where someone is spending</text><text start="493.599" dur="4.88">more than they already have on that</text><text start="495.759" dur="6.241">ledger for example if the first two</text><text start="498.479" dur="6.481">transactions are Charlie pays Alice $50</text><text start="502" dur="6.44">and Charlie pays Bob $50 if he were to</text><text start="504.96" dur="6.239">try to add Charlie pays you $20 that</text><text start="508.44" dur="5.76">would be invalid as invalid as if he had</text><text start="511.199" dur="5.64">never signed it notice this means that</text><text start="514.2" dur="4.719">verifying a transaction requires knowing</text><text start="516.839" dur="5.041">the full history of transactions up to</text><text start="518.919" dur="5.04">that point and this is more or less also</text><text start="521.88" dur="5.32">going to be true in cryptocurrencies</text><text start="523.959" dur="3.241">though there is a little room for</text><text start="527.68" dur="4.52">optimization what&amp;#39;s interesting here is</text><text start="529.959" dur="4.761">that this step removes the connection</text><text start="532.2" dur="5.56">between The Ledger and actual physical</text><text start="534.72" dur="5.2">US dollars in theory if everyone in the</text><text start="537.76" dur="4.24">world was using this Ledger you could</text><text start="539.92" dur="4.039">live your whole life just sending and</text><text start="542" dur="5.44">receiving money on this Ledger without</text><text start="543.959" dur="5.161">ever having to convert to real US dollar</text><text start="547.44" dur="3.28">in fact to emphasize this point let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="549.12" dur="5.6">start referring to the quantities on The</text><text start="550.72" dur="5.72">Ledger as Ledger dollars or LD for short</text><text start="554.72" dur="4.44">you are of course free to exchange</text><text start="556.44" dur="5.12">Ledger dollars for real US dollars for</text><text start="559.16" dur="4.64">example maybe Alice gives Bob a $10

dur="4.28">going to be guaranteed by the protocol</text><text start="574.8" dur="4.44">it&amp;#39;s now more analogous to how you might</text><text start="576.72" dur="4.92">exchange dollars for euros or any other</text><text start="579.24" dur="6.36">currency on the open market it&amp;#39;s just</text><text start="581.64" dur="5.48">its own independent thing this is the</text><text start="585.6" dur="4.2">first important thing to understand</text><text start="587.12" dur="5.92">about Bitcoin or any other</text><text start="589.8" dur="6.279">cryptocurrency what it is is a ledger</text><text start="593.04" dur="5.6">the history of transactions is the</text><text start="596.079" dur="4.121">currency of course with Bitcoin money</text><text start="598.64" dur="4">doesn&amp;#39;t enter the Ledger with people</text><text start="600.2" dur="4.28">buying in using cash I&amp;#39;ll get to how new</text><text start="602.64" dur="4.28">money enters the Ledger in just a few</text><text start="604.48" dur="4.2">minutes but before that there&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="606.92" dur="3.359">an even more significant difference</text><text start="608.68" dur="4.52">between our current system of Ledger</text><text start="610.279" dur="4.601">dollars and how cryptocurrencies work so</text><text start="613.2" dur="3.84">far I&amp;#39;ve said that this Ledger is in</text><text start="614.88" dur="4.8">some public place like a website where</text><text start="617.04" dur="5.039">anyone can add new lines but that would</text><text start="619.68" dur="4.719">require trusting a

start="884" dur="4.88">that number at the end of this list of</text><text start="885.92" dur="5.68">transactions and apply Shaw 256 to the</text><text start="888.88" dur="5.84">entire thing the first 30 bits of that</text><text start="891.6" dur="5.44">output are all zeros how hard do you</text><text start="894.72" dur="4.799">think it was for them to find that</text><text start="897.04" dur="4.64">number well for random message message</text><text start="899.519" dur="5.161">the probability that a hash happens to</text><text start="901.68" dur="5.48">start with 30 successive zeros is 1 and</text><text start="904.68" dur="5.44">2 to the 30 which is about 1 in a</text><text start="907.16" dur="5.64">billion and because sha 256 is a</text><text start="910.12" dur="4.6">cryptographic hash function the only way</text><text start="912.8" dur="4.159">to find a special number like that is</text><text start="914.72" dur="4.039">just guessing and checking so this</text><text start="916.959" dur="3.361">person almost certainly had to go</text><text start="918.759" dur="4.561">through about a billion different</text><text start="920.32" dur="4.639">numbers before finding this special one</text><text start="923.32" dur="3.72">and once you know that number it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="924.959" dur="4.68">really quick to verify you just run the</text><text start="927.04" dur="4.68">hash and see that there are 30 zeros</text><text start="929.639" dur="4.161">so in other words you can verify that</text><text start="931.72" dur="3.559">they went through a

dur="5.039">proof of work and importantly all of</text><text start="940.639" dur="4.921">this work is intrinsically tied to the</text><text start="942.959" dur="5.12">list of transactions if you change one</text><text start="945.56" dur="4.6">of those transactions even slightly it</text><text start="948.079" dur="3.68">would completely change the hash so</text><text start="950.16" dur="4.08">you&amp;#39;d have to go through another billion</text><text start="951.759" dur="4.281">guesses to find a new proof of work a</text><text start="954.24" dur="3.76">new number that makes it so that the</text><text start="956.04" dur="5.56">hash of the altered list together with</text><text start="958" dur="5.639">this new number starts with 30 zeros so</text><text start="961.6" dur="4.56">now think back to our distributed Ledger</text><text start="963.639" dur="4.56">situation everyone is there broadcasting</text><text start="966.16" dur="5.32">transactions and we want a way for them</text><text start="968.199" dur="5.08">to agree on what the correct Ledger is</text><text start="971.48" dur="3.839">as I said the core idea behind the</text><text start="973.279" dur="4.04">original Bitcoin paper is to have</text><text start="975.319" dur="4.721">everyone trust whichever Ledger has the</text><text start="977.319" dur="4.921">most work put into it the way this works</text><text start="980.04" dur="4.64">is to First organize a given Ledger into</text><text start="982.24" dur="4.24">blocks where each block consists of a</text><text start="984.68" dur="4.44">list of transactions together with a</text><text start="986.48" dur="4.4">proof of work that is a special number</text><text start="989.12" dur="4.24">so that the hash of the whole block</text><text start="990.88" dur="4.04">starts with a bunch of zeros for the</text><text start="993.36" dur="4.719">moment let&amp;#39;s say that it has to start</text><text start="994.92" dur="4.719">with oh 60 zeros but later we&amp;#39;ll return</text><text start="998.079" dur="4.12">back to a more systematic way you might</text><text start="999.639" dur="4.32">want to choose that number in the same</text><text start="1002.199" dur="3.64">way that a transaction is only</text><text start="1003.959" dur="4.56">considered valid when it&amp;#39;s signed by the</text><text start="1005.839" dur="5.8">sender a block is only considered valid</text><text start="1008.519" dur="4.8">if it has a proof of work and also to</text><text start="1011.639" dur="3.88">make sure that there&amp;#39;s a standard order</text><text start="1013.319" dur="4.64">to these blocks will make it so that a</text><text start="1015.519" dur="5.44">block has to contain the hash of the</text><text start="1017.959" dur="4.68">previous block at its header that way if</text><text start="1020.959" dur="3.72">you were to go back and change any one</text><text start="1022.639" dur="4.4">of the blocks or to swap the order of</text><text start="1024.679" dur="4.321">two blocks it would change the block</text><text start="1027.039" dur="3.92">that comes after it which changes that</text><text start="1029" dur="5.36">Block&amp;#39;s hash which changes the one that</text><text start="1030.959" dur="5.641">comes after it and so on that would</text><text start="1034.36" dur="4.04">require redoing all of the work finding</text><text start="1036.6" dur="3.68">a new special number for each of these</text><text start="1038.4" dur="3">blocks that makes their hashes start</text><text start="1040.28" dur="3.919">with 60</text><text start="1041.4" dur="5.24">zos because blocks are chained together</text><text start="1044.199" dur="5.84">like this instead of calling it a

start="1314.159" dur="3.76">there&amp;#39;s just a few details to clear up</text><text start="1316.24" dur="3.36">earlier I said that the proof of work</text><text start="1317.919" dur="3.76">might be to find a special number so</text><text start="1319.6" dur="4.92">that the hash of the block starts with</text><text start="1321.679" dur="5.201">60 zos well the way the actual Bitcoin</text><text start="1324.52" dur="4.399">protocol works is to periodically change</text><text start="1326.88" dur="4.88">that number of zeros so that it should</text><text start="1328.919" dur="5.12">take on average 10 minutes to find a new</text><text start="1331.76" dur="4.32">block so as there are more and more</text><text start="1334.039" dur="3.52">miners added to the network the</text><text start="1336.08" dur="3.52">challenge actually gets harder and</text><text start="1337.559" dur="4.561">harder in such a way that this miniature</text><text start="1339.6" dur="3.319">Lottery only has about one winner every</text><text start="1342.12" dur="3.439">10</text><text start="1342.919" dur="4.441">minutes many newer cryptocurrencies</text><text start="1345.559" dur="4">actually have much shorter block times</text><text start="1347.36" dur="4.64">than that and all of the money in</text><text start="1349.559" dur="4.681">Bitcoin ultimately comes from some block</text><text start="1352" dur="4.279">reward in the beginning these rewards</text><text start="1354.24" dur="3.72">were 50 Bitcoin per block there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1356.279" dur="3.681">actually a great website you can go to</text><text start="1357.96" dur="3.959">called block explorer that makes it easy</text><text start="1359.96" dur="3.52">to look through the Bitcoin blockchain</text><text start="1361.919" dur="3.921">and if you look at the very first few</text><text start="1363.48" dur="4.64">blocks on the Chain they contain no</text><text start="1365.84" dur="5.92">transactions other than that 50 Bitcoin</text><text start="1368.12" dur="6.84">reward to the minor but every 210,000</text><text start="1371.76" dur="5.96">blocks which is about every 4 years that</text><text start="1374.96" dur="5.88">reward gets cut in half so right now the</text><text start="1377.72" dur="4.8">reward is 12 12.5 Bitcoin per block and</text><text start="1380.84" dur="4.48">because this reward decreases</text><text start="1382.52" dur="5.279">geometrically over time it means there</text><text start="1385.32" dur="4.28">will never be more than 21 million</text><text start="1387.799"

that whenever you make a</text><text start="1400.24" dur="4.4">payment you can purely optionally</text><text start="1402.64" dur="3.76">include a little transaction fee with it</text><text start="1404.64" dur="4.56">that&amp;#39;s going to go to the minor of</text><text start="1406.4" dur="4.56">whichever block includes that payment</text><text start="1409.2" dur="3.92">the reason you might do that is to</text><text start="1410.96" dur="4.199">incentivize miners to actually include</text><text start="1413.12" dur="5.24">the transaction that you broadcast into</text><text start="1415.159" dur="5.961">the next block you see in Bitcoin each</text><text start="1418.36" dur="5.36">block is limited to about 2400</text><text start="1421.12" dur="5.84">transactions which many critics argue is</text><text start="1423.72" dur="6.4">unnecessarily restrictive for comparison</text><text start="1426.96" dur="5.04">Visa processes an average of about 1,700</text><text start="1430.12" dur="5.24">transactions per second and they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1432" dur="5.799">capable of handling more than 24,000 per</text><text start="1435.36" dur="4.799">second this comparatively slow</text><text start="1437.799" dur="4.48">processing on Bitcoin makes for higher</text><text start="1440.159" dur="4.241">transaction fees since that&amp;#39;s what</text><text start="1442.279" dur="4.88">determines which transactions miners</text><text start="1444.4" dur="5.36">choose to include in a new</text><text start="1447.159" dur="3.921">block all of this is far from a</text><text start="1449.76" dur="3.08">comprehensive coverage of</text><text start="1451.08" dur="4">cryptocurrencies there are still many</text><text start="1452.84" dur="4.48">nuances and
