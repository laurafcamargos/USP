on these axim through deductive</text><text start="11.36" dur="5.12">argument and that we have a tearing</text><text start="13.36" dur="5.88">edifice of brilliant mathematics all of</text><text start="16.48" dur="5.879">which is solidly established in an</text><text start="19.24" dur="4.799">incontrovertible way that&amp;#39;s a beautiful</text><text start="22.359" dur="4.361">kind of conception the problem is that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="24.039" dur="4.521">not true it&amp;#39;s not even close to true</text><text start="26.72" dur="3.879">it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to live up to</text><text start="28.56" dur="4.44">that fantasy some of the top</text><text start="30.599" dur="4.001">mathematicians in the world have been</text><text start="33" dur="3.8">looking at this as a philosophy question</text><text start="34.6" dur="5.36">I&amp;#39;ve been actually working with</text><text start="36.8" dur="5.279">AI if you start always inputting your</text><text start="39.96" dur="3.96">ideas your proofs into a machine at what</text><text start="42.079" dur="5.241">point does the machine do a better job</text><text start="43.92" dur="5.84">of helping Guess The Next Step obviously</text><text start="47.32" dur="5.36">this is something very hot right now</text><text start="49.76" dur="5.52">it&amp;#39;s moving fast and the question</text><text start="52.68" dur="4.92">becomes well what is it we want from</text><text start="55.28" dur="4.36">proofs what have we historically needed</text><text start="57.6" dur="4.479">from proofs what is it we believe when</text><text start="59.64" dur="5.479">something things proved and how does AI</text><text start="62.079" dur="4.761">change that these are massive questions</text><text start="65.119" dur="2.64">that that are popping out of woodwork</text><text start="66.84" dur="4.08">right</text><text start="67.759" dur="5.281">now I&amp;#39;m Andrew Granville I work in</text><text start="70.92" dur="3.839">analytic number Theory when I was young</text><text start="73.04" dur="4.439">I worked on firas Last Theorem before it</text><text start="74.759" dur="4.641">was proved today I work in ideas of L</text><text start="77.479" dur="4.161">functions and multiplicative functions</text><text start="79.4" dur="4.64">but I&amp;#39;m interested in all different</text><text start="81.64" dur="3.839">aspects including computational and</text><text start="84.04" dur="4">algorithmic</text><text start="85.479" dur="4.64">questions I&amp;#39;ve long been interested in</text><text start="88.04" dur="4.28">popular writing and Mathematics my</text><text start="90.119" dur="4.121">sister is a writer we&amp;#39;ve been thinking</text><text start="92.32" dur="3.72">it would be fun to do a graphic novel in</text><text start="94.24" dur="4.64">mathematics so we worked together to</text><text start="96.04" dur="5.52">develop it and eventually wrote it in</text><text start="98.88" dur="5.879">the graphic novel I felt like there was</text><text start="101.56" dur="6.12">room for us to develop</text><text start="104.759" dur="5.4">philosophy a philosopher of mathematics</text><text start="107.68" dur="5.28">Michael Hallet read it and he was very</text><text start="110.159" dur="4.081">interested in the way we portrayed</text><text start="112.96" dur="4.519">mathematics being</text><text start="114.24" dur="5.879">done you cannot prove them because you</text><text start="117.479" dur="5.161">cannot go back to anything more more</text><text start="120.119" dur="5.161">primitive than those propositions</text><text start="122.64" dur="4.519">themselves they are not in need of</text><text start="125.28" dur="4.64">justification talking to Michael I</text><text start="127.159" dur="4.641">realized there is this debate of what it</text><text start="129.92" dur="4.28">is we mean when we say we&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="131.8" dur="2.4">something</text><text start="134.48" dur="6.119">proved so Aristotle said that to prove</text><text start="137.84" dur="5.28">something is true to establish it&amp;#39;s true</text><text start="140.599" dur="4.401">your argument should rest on what he</text><text start="143.12" dur="4">called Primitives things you already</text><text start="145" dur="4.319">knew to be true and eventually there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="147.12" dur="4.28">got to be some atoms there the So-Cal</text><text start="149.319" dur="5.321">axium that you rest all your arguments</text><text start="151.4" dur="4.96">on the basic things you cannot Define so</text><text start="154.64" dur="4.28">like point line plane if you&amp;#39;re talking</text><text start="156.36" dur="5.64">about geometry you can&amp;#39;t define those</text><text start="158.92" dur="5.239">what you do instead is lay down some</text><text start="162" dur="4.239">axioms about them the the phrase that</text><text start="164.159" dur="4.561">comes to my mind is these truths are</text><text start="166.239" dur="4.161">self-evident um which you know is</text><text start="168.72" dur="3.92">interesting at many levels when you</text><text start="170.4" dur="4.839">compare it to mathematics I mean there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="172.64" dur="4.2">a certain arrogance about it the way</text><text start="175.239" dur="3.161">it&amp;#39;s traditionally been done is that we</text><text start="176.84" dur="3.52">publish papers and there papers are put</text><text start="178.4" dur="3.479">in journals or books and</text><text start="180.36" dur="4.28">those books are put in libraries and</text><text start="181.879" dur="4.321">then when we wanted to verify a truth we</text><text start="184.64" dur="3.44">go to the library and we&amp;#39; check out the</text><text start="186.2" dur="4.319">book and we&amp;#39;d see if it was exactly as</text><text start="188.08" dur="4.4">we wanted it it would help us gain new</text><text start="190.519" dur="4.601">understanding or we&amp;#39;d have to revise</text><text start="192.48" dur="4.679">what was in those books today the</text><text start="195.12" dur="4">artificial intelligence that is used for</text><text start="197.159" dur="3.681">proof they&amp;#39;re doing something similar</text><text start="199.12" dur="4.119">except they&amp;#39;re going to store that</text><text start="200.84" dur="5.479">information within the</text><text start="203.239" dur="5.241">program so programs like lean have a</text><text start="206.319" dur="5">library of things already proven based</text><text start="208.48" dur="5.52">on axioms and then with suitable work</text><text start="211.319" dur="4.601">and it&amp;#39;s complicated a mathematician can</text><text start="214" dur="4.08">input their proof into lean and verify</text><text start="215.92" dur="5.8">all the steps logical at least according</text><text start="218.08" dur="6.28">to lean so what does lean do I think I</text><text start="221.72" dur="5.64">have a proof of a theorem and I want a</text><text start="224.36" dur="4.959">formal proof I&amp;#39;ve written something that</text><text start="227.36" dur="4.04">I&amp;#39;m a bit iffy about I don&amp;#39;t want to get</text><text start="229.319" dur="4.12">into all of the details of the ins and</text><text start="231.4" dur="3.64">outs of you know as you sort of go back</text><text start="233.439" dur="4.041">through the tree of knowledge</text><text start="235.04" dur="5.919">everything&amp;#39;s really going to work so the</text><text start="237.48" dur="6.039">idea is to input that into lean it acts</text><text start="240.959" dur="5.36">like an obnoxious colleague who just</text><text start="243.519" dur="5.8">won&amp;#39;t let go if a don&amp;#39;t understand a</text><text start="246.319" dur="5.401">will not stop pestering you annoying</text><text start="249.319" dur="4.56">questions but sometimes those colleagues</text><text start="251.72" dur="5.32">actually help you because by explaining</text><text start="253.879" dur="5.241">it to them you realize oh yeah oh and</text><text start="257.04" dur="3.879">it&amp;#39;s simpler than I thought this is</text><text start="259.12" dur="3.799">particularly famous example by Peter</text><text start="260.919" dur="4.28">schulzer he had a very very difficult</text><text start="262.919" dur="4.201">proof but he wasn&amp;#39;t 100% sure of he</text><text start="265.199" dur="3.241">would try and say well this is true and</text><text start="267.12" dur="2.56">you should know this lean and lean would</text><text start="268.44" dur="3.24">say I don&amp;#39;t know this at all you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="269.68" dur="4.6">going to have to explain this better the</text><text start="271.68" dur="4.239">bits where he had been uncomfortable</text><text start="274.28" dur="4.479">with what he&amp;#39;d written it was where it</text><text start="275.919" dur="5.081">asked the most questions so he felt okay</text><text start="278.759" dur="4.801">that was verification it was sensibly</text><text start="281" dur="5.28">asking the right questions so it&amp;#39;s an</text><text start="283.56" dur="5.199">exciting time the question is will</text><text start="286.28" dur="6.199">machines change</text><text start="288.759" dur="6.201">mathematics how do you get computers to</text><text start="292.479" dur="5.041">lead you in a proof not just follow you</text><text start="294.96" dur="5.04">or make suggestions but prove things</text><text start="297.52" dur="3.959">itself this is something in its INF y a</text><text start="300" dur="5.28">lot of the work on computer generated</text><text start="301.479" dur="5.841">proofs up to now has not done much of</text><text start="305.28" dur="4.479">consequence I&amp;#39;m very interested within</text><text start="307.32" dur="4.08">itself but not in the bigger picture but</text><text start="309.759" dur="5">there are some very interesting exciting</text><text start="311.4" dur="7.12">new ideas which one has some optimism</text><text start="314.759" dur="6.681">that we may see the start of generating</text><text start="318.52" dur="4.36">interesting new proofs and so this</text><text start="321.44" dur="3.4">starts to become a little frightening I</text><text start="322.88" dur="4.92">mean we value our profession we value</text><text start="324.84" dur="5.04">our work by the profundity of proofs but</text><text start="327.8" dur="4.64">if we can rely on a machine get all the</text><text start="329.88" dur="5.24">details right most of the details right</text><text start="332.44" dur="4.199">then who are we what is our training</text><text start="335.12" dur="4.6">what is it that we</text><text start="336.639" dur="4.84">value so when we don&amp;#39;t need to think</text><text start="339.72" dur="4.08">about proof then we&amp;#39;re not going to be</text><text start="341.479" dur="3.361">trained in thinking about proof so who</text><text start="343.8" dur="2.64">are we going to become we&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="344.84" dur="3.24">become more like physicist probably and</text><text start="346.44" dur="3.96">say any old nonsense and just hope the</text><text start="348.08" dur="4.04">computer verifies it I think it&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="350.4" dur="3.919">hard to predict what even will be the</text><text start="352.12" dur="4.44">point of doing mathematics in 30 40</text><text start="354.319" dur="6.041">years</text><text start="356.56" dur="5.8">time the idea of computer Genera proofs</text><text start="360.36" dur="4.44">these present new</text><text start="362.36" dur="4.52">possibilities over time we see of course</text><text start="364.8" dur="4.679">more and more things that computers are</text><text start="366.88" dur="5.159">able to do um and it&amp;#39;s very unclear what</text><text start="369.479" dur="2.56">limits there</text><text start="378.6"
