dur="5.28">the day and last year when it snowed and</text><text start="16.16" dur="5.199">we actually have a decent amount of snow</text><text start="18.16" dur="5.44">which is surprising uh we built a sled</text><text start="21.359" dur="4.08">and uh my roommate and I built a sled</text><text start="23.6" dur="3.439">out of spare parts from a dynamics</text><text start="25.439" dur="3.201">project I think that were surprisingly</text><text start="27.039" dur="3.601">sled shaped we had everything we needed</text><text start="28.64" dur="4.079">to in the apartment</text><text start="30.64" dur="5.56">if the new skids only get one run I want</text><text start="32.719" dur="3.481">to have it on film</text><text start="42.239" dur="5.281">are a good idea and uh we called it the</text><text start="45.04" dur="4.48">Mark 1 so this year it&amp;#39;s snowing and I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="47.52" dur="4.48">going to try to make a really nice one</text><text start="49.52" dur="4.32">and again out of things that I just keep</text><text start="52" dur="5.879">around i didn&amp;#39;t go out and buy things</text><text start="53.84" dur="6.399">specifically for this um single sheet of</text><text start="57.879" dur="6.921">plywood that I think I&amp;#39;ve actually had</text><text start="60.239" dur="4.561">for like two years and done nothing with</text><text start="65.32" dur="7.72">and PVC which is the greatest building</text><text start="68.72" dur="4.32">material no demand and really dirt</text><text start="73.32" dur="6.56">cheap so I&amp;#39;ve got the uh heat gun i&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="77.2" dur="6.48">got the drill battery in place and</text><text start="79.88" dur="3.8">uh should be fun</text><text start="84" dur="4">all right so the the runners for the</text><text start="86.159" dur="4.96">sled this is going to be the base of the</text><text start="88" dur="6.64">sled i want to make out of PVC because</text><text start="91.119" dur="5.201">it&amp;#39;s plastic and I actually have uh a</text><text start="94.64" dur="4.4">candle left over from when I tried to</text><text start="96.32" dur="4.159">make a miniature fire tornado which did</text><text start="99.04" dur="3.439">not work but I have a candle so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="100.479" dur="3.841">going to try to wax the rails last year</text><text start="102.479" dur="4.081">we actually put duct tape over the rails</text><text start="104.32" dur="5">and that worked surprisingly well but it</text><text start="106.56" dur="4.96">needed to be replaced a lot so these are</text><text start="109.32" dur="3.56">actually lengths that I&amp;#39;ve already cut</text><text start="111.52" dur="4.4">for a different project that I never</text><text start="112.88" dur="4.76">built so I&amp;#39;m thinking that these might</text><text start="115.92" dur="5.44">be perfect</text><text start="117.64" dur="8.28">sizes if I heat gun them around to be</text><text start="121.36" dur="4.56">sled runners so I will find</text><text start="127.8" dur="7.439">out you can heat gun PVC into like an</text><text start="132" dur="5.64">unbelievable variety of shapes in</text><text start="135.239" dur="4.161">fact this right</text><text start="137.64" dur="6.04">now</text><text start="139.4" dur="7.88">is being filmed on a tripod made of PVC</text><text start="143.68" dur="6.559">with a holder that actually Well I could</text><text start="147.28" dur="4.959">just flip this camera around but you can</text><text start="150.239" dur="5.241">make a lot of stuff out of PVC so I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="152.239" dur="8">going to be actually bending these</text><text start="155.48" dur="6.28">rails and uh I have a template that I</text><text start="160.239" dur="5.761">put out here on the wood just made of</text><text start="161.76" dur="7.36">tape and uh see how it works i&amp;#39;ll try to</text><text start="166" dur="4.4">roughly center these up and the trick is</text><text start="169.12" dur="2.96">that when you&amp;#39;re heat guning you never</text><text start="170.4" dur="4.24">want to stay in one place or you&amp;#39;ll burn</text><text start="172.08" dur="4.48">it so you actually want to uh keep it</text><text start="174.64" dur="4.319">moving and keep this rotating and then</text><text start="176.56" dur="3.759">as you bend around something it helps if</text><text start="178.959" dur="4.521">you&amp;#39;ve got a form but you don&amp;#39;t really</text><text start="180.319" dur="3.161">need one</text><text start="189.92" dur="5.599">channel locks best type of pliers in</text><text start="195.72" dur="5.56">history also good for bending</text><text start="198.92" dur="3.56">PVC because of course it gets hot you</text><text start="201.28" dur="4.2">don&amp;#39;t really want to have your hand on</text><text start="202.48" dur="3">that</text><text start="233.84" dur="5.2">starting to get soft now the pipe swells</text><text start="235.84" dur="3.2">up a little bit and the end is</text><text start="253.319" dur="4.721">moving just trying to make about a 90Â°</text><text start="256.32" dur="4.439">bend</text><text start="258.04" dur="6.92">here i&amp;#39;m trying to preserve as much of</text><text start="260.759" dur="5.641">the pipe&amp;#39;s integrity as possible so</text><text start="264.96" dur="4.04">often when you heat gun it and then you</text><text start="266.4" dur="5.28">try to bend it as a full pipe it&amp;#39;ll just</text><text start="269" dur="3.52">crease i&amp;#39;m trying to avoid that so get</text><text start="271.68" dur="5.44">it</text><text start="272.52" dur="7.56">real soupy hot and uh very slowly bend</text><text start="277.12" dur="2.96">it so that it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="281.56" dur="6.16">crease and I&amp;#39;m using a blue tape roll as</text><text start="284.56" dur="3.16">a form</text><text start="316.8" dur="4.92">now is it</text><text start="317.96" dur="8.079">ready yeah it&amp;#39;s more</text><text start="321.72" dur="4.319">ready it&amp;#39;s readyer</text><text start="331.52" dur="5.6">so there we go</text><text start="333.919" dur="5.361">that is the front runner of one side of</text><text start="337.12" dur="2.16">the</text><text start="341.96" dur="5.16">sled does like to unbend on you if you</text><text start="344.479" dur="2.641">don&amp;#39;t keep holding</text><text start="347.479" dur="6.28">it and real</text><text start="350.62" dur="3.139">[Music]</text><text start="354.12" dur="3.799">quick there we go</text><text start="359.479" dur="7.681">here we go one sled runner just need one</text><text start="364.16" dur="3">more</text><text start="396.319" dur="3.401">there we go</text><text start="403.919" dur="7.56">so these are not exactly the same size</text><text start="406.56" dur="9.04">but um I expect they&amp;#39;ll still</text><text start="411.479" dur="4.121">work as well as they</text><text start="417.88" dur="6.4">can for being thrown together in like 20</text><text start="421.28" dur="3">minutes</text><text start="430.36" dur="6.92">now best way with no cement to attach</text><text start="433.52" dur="6.88">PVC especially PVC that you&amp;#39;ve like</text><text start="437.28" dur="7.4">mangled the ends of to each other that I</text><text start="440.4" dur="6.519">found is uh to simply</text><text start="444.68" dur="5.88">use drywall</text><text start="446.919" dur="6.12">screws use this technique to make a uh a</text><text start="450.56" dur="5.88">boat out of PVC actually it&amp;#39;s actually</text><text start="453.039" dur="3.401">not that bad</text><text start="457.759" dur="4">so these are what like inch and a</text><text start="460.319" dur="5.521">they&amp;#39;re inch and a quarter drywall</text><text start="461.759" dur="7.44">screws nice coarse thread and uh they go</text><text start="465.84" dur="3.359">right they eat through this</text><text start="471.72" dur="4.879">plastic figure out where I&amp;#39;m putting</text><text start="473.599" dur="3">holes</text><text start="487.52" dur="4.359">garbage can this isn&amp;#39;t a shop nor do I</text><text start="490.24" dur="4.48">have a shop vac</text><text start="491.879" dur="7.04">so sadly all drilling and dremeling has</text><text start="494.72" dur="4.199">to take place over a garbage can</text><text start="522.76" dur="5.72">huh now I&amp;#39;ve got an issue i don&amp;#39;t think</text><text start="525.2" dur="4.52">I have a uh a driving bit for Phillips</text><text start="528.48" dur="6.039">so this is going to be</text><text start="529.72" dur="4.799">fun the oldfashioned way</text><text start="546.08" dur="5.84">it&amp;#39;s not totally straight but we&amp;#39;ll be</text><text start="548.48" dur="3.44">able to fix it with a heat gun in a few</text><text start="552.68" dur="5.04">minutes it&amp;#39;s certainly not coming off</text><text start="579.12" dur="4.8">now we have a sled so they&amp;#39;re a little</text><text start="581.519" dur="3.841">bit out of alignment so I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="583.92" dur="2.56">Well that one&amp;#39;s fine but this one&amp;#39;s</text><text start="585.36" dur="4.12">curved in a little bit so I&amp;#39;m going to</text><text start="586.48" dur="6.64">heat gun that a little bit and</text><text start="589.48" dur="5.96">uh try</text><text start="593.12" dur="4.159">to put on some wax i don&amp;#39;t know if</text><text start="595.44" dur="5">that&amp;#39;s going to help or not but makes me</text><text start="597.279" dur="3.161">feel better</text><text start="622.32" dur="7.4">see how this wax thing</text><text start="624.36" dur="5.36">goes i&amp;#39;m not entirely convinced myself</text><text start="651.279" dur="5.721">melts into a real nice thin</text><text start="653.72" dur="6.119">sheet i&amp;#39;m expecting this to fly on</text><text start="657" dur="4.839">snow the rails are completely done and</text><text start="659.839" dur="5.041">they&amp;#39;re waxed and everything but the</text><text start="661.839" dur="3.041">sled has a bit of a</text><text start="665.16" dur="5.32">problem it wobbles so I&amp;#39;m going to heat</text><text start="668.88" dur="3.44">up all the edges and then press it flat</text><text start="670.48" dur="4">against the floor and try to straighten</text><text start="672.32" dur="2.16">it</text><text start="677.64" dur="6">out how much i just do it like that</text><text start="681.519" dur="6.121">actually</text><text start="683.64" dur="6.12">yeah all that needs to happen bend one</text><text start="687.64" dur="3.72">because you can find where the other</text><text start="689.76" dur="5.24">three balance and then push one down and</text><text start="691.36" dur="3.64">it&amp;#39;ll work just fine</text><text start="696.399" dur="4.041">but you need to hold it there</text><text start="713.44" dur="3">ready</text><text start="717.2" dur="5.72">i&amp;#39;m going it looks like this has been</text><text start="719.92" dur="8.68">done got to find a spot just do</text><text start="722.92" dur="5.68">it too bad oh on your Okay</text><text start="728.88" dur="3.48">oh my god</text><text start="734.24" dur="6.719">okay and take Well the first attempt of</text><text start="739.04" dur="3.28">uh running this did not go very well so</text><text start="740.959" dur="4.241">what I ended up doing was actually</text><text start="742.32" dur="5.88">adding some of these cross braces which</text><text start="745.2" dur="7.36">did work very well okay this is Brian</text><text start="748.2" dur="9.48">Sled uh February 24th 2015 with added</text><text start="752.56" dur="5.12">support point from two point model</text><text start="758.36" dur="6.36">2.0 yay</text><text start="761.92" dur="6.359">it&amp;#39;s not the straightest ride</text><text start="764.72" dur="3.559">do it on your stomach</text><text start="779.839" dur="7.961">that was the most satisfying thing</text><text start="783.839" dur="3.961">it will choose the direction</text><text start="788.56" dur="4.56">oh</text><text start="790.56" dur="4.24">well done</text><text start="793.12" dur="2.839">that really scared me for a second hey</text><text start="794.8" dur="3.839">that was</text><text start="795.959" dur="6.641">metal try to sit on it i want to see if</text><text start="798.639" dur="3.961">you bail the way we did</text><text start="802.72" dur="5.6">got to love easy roommates</text><text start="806" dur="6.2">guinea pigs hey look gullibles written</text><text start="808.32" dur="3.88">on the sky what</text><text start="821.639" dur="6.921">he sledded on these cross braces for</text><text start="825.2" dur="4.96">quite a while but on a variety of hills</text><text start="828.56" dur="3.76">but then when we found a hill that had a</text><text start="830.16" dur="3.679">few bumps in it when you get up enough</text><text start="832.32" dur="3.6">speed and you go off even a short bump</text><text start="833.839" dur="4.721">and come back down it puts a lot of</text><text start="835.92" dur="6.64">stress on these and actually we ended up</text><text start="838.56" dur="6">breaking two of them so it uh it didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="842.56" dur="5.04">total the sled you can still ride on it</text><text start="844.56" dur="4.56">cuz these are still fairly rigid but uh</text><text start="847.6" dur="4.08">I think they need to be repaired before</text><text start="849.12" dur="4.64">it can be taken out out again and today</text><text start="851.68" dur="5.36">there is more snow so I will be doing</text><text start="853.76" dur="5.36">that but uh the original problem is that</text><text start="857.04" dur="5.039">these two things actually just collapsed</text><text start="859.12" dur="5.44">over because they were only held on by</text><text start="862.079" dur="5.44">these screws and they were wobbling like</text><text start="864.56" dur="6.16">this so what these braces do is just</text><text start="867.519" dur="5.361">hold them in place but when you push</text><text start="870.72" dur="5.52">from the top with a lot of force puts a</text><text start="872.88" dur="4.72">lot of force on these brackets the uh</text><text start="876.24" dur="5.279">really interesting thing about the way</text><text start="877.6" dur="6.16">this broke before is that uh I was</text><text start="881.519" dur="3.921">originally worried that it was cold that</text><text start="883.76" dur="4.16">we were actually hitting some brutal</text><text start="885.44" dur="3.839">transition of PVC but I don&amp;#39;t think that</text><text start="887.92" dur="4.479">that was the case because everywhere</text><text start="889.279" dur="6.161">that I found uh said that PVC go under</text><text start="892.399" dur="5.361">goes a brutal transition uh between like</text><text start="895.44" dur="5.92">7 and 15 degrees and it was in the 20s</text><text start="897.76" dur="5.28">here Fahrenheit at the time that uh we</text><text start="901.36" dur="4.4">were sledding so I don&amp;#39;t think that that</text><text start="903.04" dur="5.12">was the fault but PVC is a generically</text><text start="905.76" dur="4.639">brittle material so maybe this isn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="908.16" dur="3.919">quite the best application for it but uh</text><text start="910.399" dur="4.321">it&amp;#39;s certainly easy to throw together i</text><text start="912.079" dur="4.081">think that this entire sled uh if you</text><text start="914.72" dur="3.28">consider that I had a piece of wood</text><text start="916.16" dur="6.799">laying around all the PVC on here is</text><text start="918" dur="6.88">like $3 maybe so it&amp;#39;s like the world&amp;#39;s</text><text start="922.959" dur="5.641">cheapest building material and easy to</text><text start="924.88" dur="3.72">repair when it does break</text><text
