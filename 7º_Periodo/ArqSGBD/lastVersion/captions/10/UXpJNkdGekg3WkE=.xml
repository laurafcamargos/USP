dur="5.039">all four suits separated in a deck but</text><text start="66.08" dur="4.8">by perfectly interleaving them twice you</text><text start="68.479" dur="4.561">could get a shuffle deck where every</text><text start="70.88" dur="4">fourth card was the same suit so if you</text><text start="73.04" dur="4.32">dealt them out to four players everyone</text><text start="74.88" dur="4.8">would

from another video that i</text><text start="115.36" dur="4.56">put out a couple years ago and this</text><text start="117.28" dur="5.36">actually uses quantum mechanics to</text><text start="119.92" dur="4.799">generate true random numbers basically</text><text start="122.64" dur="3.839">there&amp;#39;s a circuit inside that counts if</text><text start="124.719" dur="4.16">we turn it down you can see how slow</text><text start="126.479" dur="4.48">it&amp;#39;s going it counts from zero to nine</text><text start="128.879" dur="4.72">over and over and over and over again</text><text

the back every time</text><text start="138.239" dur="4.161">that this geiger tube detects a tick</text><text start="140.56" dur="3.92">that means that some</text><text start="142.4" dur="3.839">high

a</text><text start="148.72" dur="4.96">muon coming down from the sky and about</text><text start="151.76" dur="4.24">the other half the time that&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="153.68" dur="5.52">be some radioactive particle coming out</text><text start="156" dur="5.04">of the earth&amp;#39;s crust say a uranium atom</text><text start="159.2" dur="3.6">decayed somewhere below me

dur="4.8">don&amp;#39;t worry there&amp;#39;s not going to be a</text><text start="185.04" dur="5.6">quiz but because the first item in that</text><text start="188.64" dur="3.92">equation is</text><text start="190.64" dur="4.16">time change between ticks on a geiger</text><text start="192.56" dur="4.319">counter that is something that is</text><text start="194.8" dur="4.48">physically unpredictable which means</text><text start="196.879" dur="5.521">that the output of this machine is</text><text start="199.28" dur="5.599">random i will say freely admit that this</text><text start="202.4" dur="4.8">box is not perfect the output is very</text><text start="204.879" dur="4.961">very slightly correlated i&amp;#39;ve never</text><text start="207.2" dur="4.88">actually bothered to check the normal</text><text start="209.84" dur="5.92">distribution of numbers coming out of it</text><text start="212.08" dur="6.879">but regardless it is random so shuffling</text><text start="215.76" dur="5.759">cards is another system that is designed</text><text start="218.959" dur="4.881">to produce unpredictable output but</text><text start="221.519" dur="4.561">because this is sort of a more idealized</text><text start="223.84" dur="4.08">version we&amp;#39;re going to shelve the card</text><text start="226.08" dur="4.4">game for a minute and talk geiger</text><text start="227.92" dur="4.959">counters i swear it&amp;#39;ll all make sense</text><text start="230.48" dur="4.56">with the original electronics that lived</text><text start="232.879" dur="4.481">inside of this random number generator i</text><text start="235.04" dur="5.04">think that what i was actually doing was</text><text start="237.36" dur="4.64">just slowly increasing the voltage on</text><text start="240.08" dur="3.92">the geiger tube and at some point it</text><text start="242" dur="3.84">would arc and that would be the tick</text><text start="244" dur="4.48">that i heard and then it would fall down</text><text start="245.84" dur="6.24">and it would slowly charge up again and</text><text start="248.48" dur="5.52">this is decidedly not random behavior</text><text start="252.08" dur="4.32">because it takes approximately the same</text><text start="254" dur="4.72">amount of time to charge up the tube to</text><text start="256.4" dur="4.88">an arcing voltage every time that it</text><text start="258.72" dur="5.12">ticks when i rebuilt the machine and</text><text start="261.28" dur="4.56">made a video about it i wanted to know</text><text start="263.84" dur="4.639">that the ticks on the geiger tube were</text><text start="265.84" dur="4.88">actual particle detection events and</text><text start="268.479" dur="3.44">they were actually randomly distributed</text><text start="270.72" dur="3.199">so that</text><text start="271.919" dur="3.361">you know i wasn&amp;#39;t fooling myself again</text><text start="273.919" dur="3.361">into thinking that i&amp;#39;d built a random</text><text start="275.28" dur="3.76">number generator when i hadn&amp;#39;t and the</text><text start="277.28" dur="4.88">cool thing is that we can do this with</text><text start="279.04" dur="5.52">statistics you might not think that</text><text start="282.16" dur="4.16">random numbers should obey statistics</text><text start="284.56" dur="3.68">they&amp;#39;re random if you get a single</text><text start="286.32" dur="5.12">random number you can&amp;#39;t say anything</text><text start="288.24" dur="7.04">about it it&amp;#39;s unpredictable but if you</text><text start="291.44" dur="5.759">have a large number of random numbers</text><text start="295.28" dur="4.24">if you have a lot of random numbers you</text><text start="297.199" dur="4.881">can actually with pretty great certainty</text><text start="299.52" dur="5.119">say what the behavior of that collective</text><text start="302.08" dur="4.88">of random numbers will be if you combine</text><text start="304.639" dur="4.4">them and average them all together in</text><text start="306.96" dur="5.04">sort of a clever way let&amp;#39;s say we have</text><text start="309.039" dur="6">an idealized signal emitting pulses at</text><text start="312" dur="5.039">random times but on average about a</text><text start="315.039" dur="4.481">pulse every five seconds you may</text><text start="317.039" dur="4.801">intuitively say that it&amp;#39;s unlikely for</text><text start="319.52" dur="4.64">you to go 30 seconds without receiving a</text><text start="321.84" dur="5.04">pulse in this setup and this intuition</text><text start="324.16" dur="5.84">is correct and without any math we can</text><text start="326.88" dur="4.96">just test this by brute force simulation</text><text start="330" dur="4.08">so if we open up matlab we can make a</text><text start="331.84" dur="3.84">list of random times let&amp;#39;s say that</text><text start="334.08" dur="4.399">there are all the times that the geiger</text><text start="335.68" dur="6.16">counter detected a pulse if we generate</text><text start="338.479" dur="7.601">1 000 times that occur at random</text><text start="341.84" dur="6.32">intervals between 0 and 5 000 seconds</text><text start="346.08" dur="4.48">then on average there&amp;#39;s 5 seconds</text><text start="348.16" dur="4.96">between each geiger pulse here we can</text><text start="350.56" dur="6.24">see there was a pulse at 2.6 seconds a</text><text start="353.12" dur="6.56">pulse at 5.7 seconds a pulse at 23.1</text><text start="356.8" dur="6.64">seconds and so on but of course the time</text><text start="359.68" dur="5.519">between any two adjacent pulses may vary</text><text start="363.44" dur="4.16">i mean if we take this whole list and</text><text start="365.199" dur="5.201">subtract it from its shift itself we can</text><text start="367.6" dur="4.719">get a list of time intervals between</text><text start="370.4" dur="4.16">adjacent pulses and obviously these</text><text start="372.319" dur="4.88">aren&amp;#39;t all the same this is basically a</text><text start="374.56" dur="4.88">list of wait times you&amp;#39;re asking after</text><text start="377.199" dur="4.641">the geiger counter detects a pulse how</text><text start="379.44" dur="5.36">long do you have to wait until another</text><text start="381.84" dur="5.04">pulse is detected if we take a histogram</text><text start="384.8" dur="4.959">of this list we find that most of the</text><text start="386.88" dur="4.8">wait times are extremely short less than</text><text start="389.759" dur="4.801">you know three seconds here although the</text><text start="391.68" dur="5.519">average time between pulses is still 5</text><text start="394.56" dur="5.44">seconds it&amp;#39;s extremely unlikely that</text><text start="397.199" dur="5.761">there will ever be a gap of say a minute</text><text start="400" dur="5.12">between pulses in our 5 000 second</text><text start="402.96" dur="4.48">sample here the longest gap between</text><text start="405.12" dur="4.479">pulses that showed up was about 38</text><text start="407.44" dur="4.56">seconds which is actually surprisingly</text><text start="409.599" dur="4.641">long like i said before the more random</text><text start="412" dur="4.639">numbers you use the easier they are to</text><text start="414.24" dur="4.56">predict so with a thousand clicks here</text><text start="416.639" dur="4.801">you may already be able to see the shape</text><text start="418.8" dur="5.28">this graph is making it looks kinda like</text><text start="421.44" dur="4.96">exponential decay but just to be sure</text><text start="424.08" dur="4.64">let&amp;#39;s crunch the y-axis down into a log</text><text start="426.4" dur="4.16">scale and yep now</text><text start="428.72" dur="5.039">it&amp;#39;s a really beautiful straight line</text><text start="430.56" dur="5.199">this is definitely exponential decay so</text><text start="433.759" dur="3.121">this is all rather abstract</text><text start="435.759" dur="3.361">what does</text><text start="436.88" dur="4.08">a histogram of</text><text start="439.12" dur="4.16">random numbers pulled out of a matlab</text><text start="440.96" dur="4.079">program have anything to do with this</text><text start="443.28" dur="3.68">random number machine and

dur="4">about it like i said before when i was</text><text start="450.08" dur="5.44">testing this machine i wanted to know</text><text start="452.4" dur="5.76">that it was actually random and to test</text><text start="455.52" dur="4.64">that i set a microphone next to it and</text><text start="458.16" dur="3.92">just listen to the ticks off the geiger</text><text start="460.16" dur="4.08">counter because that was actually the</text><text start="462.08" dur="3.839">easiest way to collect a lot of data</text><text start="464.24" dur="4.399">when you look at this waveform there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="465.919" dur="4.72">these obvious clicks that are presumably</text><text start="468.639" dur="4.161">particle detection events in the geiger</text><text start="470.639" dur="4.161">counter and if we measure the gaps</text><text start="472.8" dur="4.88">between each of these clicks take a</text><text start="474.8" dur="3.6">histogram and plot it on a log scale we</text><text start="477.68" dur="2.48">get</text><text start="478.4" dur="3.02">drum roll please</text><text start="480.16" dur="3.41">exponential decay</text><text start="481.42"

actually wire the geiger</text><text start="492.72" dur="4.879">tube properly apparently because there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="495.039" dur="3.681">a pretty long delay where once the

or</text><text start="550.88" dur="5.68">pharaoh shuffle you need to get a run of</text><text start="553.44" dur="5.68">perfectly interleaved cards that&amp;#39;s 52</text><text start="556.56"

around</text><text start="563.519" dur="5.041">all day and shuffle cards and check</text><text start="565.92" dur="4.96">every time and you know once you had</text><text start="568.56" dur="4.88">perfectly faro shuffled maybe four or</text><text start="570.88" dur="4.32">five times you could take the number of</text><text start="573.44" dur="4.72">times that you successfully pharaoh</text><text start="575.2" dur="5.92">shuffled divide it by the total number</text><text start="578.16" dur="5.04">of times that you attempted to get a</text><text start="581.12" dur="4.96">pharaoh shuffle and then you&amp;#39;d get your</text><text start="583.2" dur="5.92">statistics but that would take forever</text><text start="586.08" dur="5.28">so i decided not to do that i don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="589.12" dur="4.48">if anyone has ever done analysis like</text><text start="591.36" dur="4.479">this on shuffling cards before i guess i</text><text start="593.6" dur="5.28">assume that they have but</text><text start="595.839" dur="5.68">my gut reaction when i saw matt&amp;#39;s video</text><text start="598.88" dur="5.76">to say man how likely is it to get a</text><text start="601.519" dur="6.241">pharaoh shuffle was to just count runs</text><text start="604.64" dur="6.56">of cards that are shorter than 52 and</text><text start="607.76" dur="5.519">extrapolate how difficult it would be to</text><text start="611.2" dur="4.079">get a pharaoh shuffle without ever</text><text start="613.279" dur="4.961">actually performing a fair shuffle just</text><text start="615.279" dur="4.881">say well yeah you know to get a run of</text><text start="618.24" dur="4.4">three cards in a row or five cards in a</text><text start="620.16" dur="4.08">row it&amp;#39;s you know x difficult and if you</text><text start="622.64" dur="5.12">want to get 20 cards in a row it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="624.24" dur="4.96">harder so how difficult is 52 i also was</text><text start="627.76" dur="4.16">kind of hoping that they would be</text><text start="629.2" dur="5.68">randomly distributed in the same way</text><text start="631.92" dur="5.599">that ticks off a geiger tube are and</text><text start="634.88" dur="5.28">as it turns out they are to test this i</text><text start="637.519" dur="4.641">took a new deck of cards and split it in</text><text start="640.16" dur="4.64">half so i was always shuffling with 26</text><text start="642.16" dur="5.359">cards in each hand then i&amp;#39;d shuffle the</text><text

hand and not just</text><text start="674.48" dur="5.2">simulating it on a computer because i</text><text start="676.64" dur="6">honestly have no idea what the ideal</text><text start="679.68" dur="5.12">shuffle is or should be as you shuffle a</text><text start="682.64" dur="4.16">deck of cards if you go longer and</text><text start="684.8" dur="3.52">longer without cards coming from one</text><text start="686.8" dur="3.76">hand you&amp;#39;re actually still moving your</text><text start="688.32" dur="4.56">fingers so a card from this hand is</text><text start="690.56" dur="4.32">actually becoming more and more likely</text><text start="692.88" dur="4.959">the longer that a card doesn&amp;#39;t come from</text><text start="694.88" dur="5.28">this hand it&amp;#39;s weird that all of the</text><text start="697.839" dur="5.041">probabilities of you know which card</text><text start="700.16" dur="4.799">falls next are modifying each other and</text><text start="702.88" dur="4.24">have history and nothing&amp;#39;s really</text><text start="704.959" dur="4.161">obviously supposed to be normally</text><text start="707.12" dur="5.04">randomly distributed so i just did it</text><text start="709.12" dur="5.36">for real like a good experimentalist</text><text start="712.16" dur="4.08">i actually think that anybody doing this</text><text start="714.48" dur="4">would get a slightly different result</text><text start="716.24" dur="4.64">than me because we all shuffle cards</text><text start="718.48" dur="4.64">slightly differently in fact the average</text><text start="720.88" dur="5.199">number of cards that participate in</text><text start="723.12" dur="6.08">these 1-1-1 interleaved sections</text><text start="726.079" dur="5.681">increased measurably over my first 20 or</text><text start="729.2" dur="5.68">30 shuffles and the average length of</text><text start="731.76" dur="5.199">these 111 interleaved runs increased</text><text start="734.88" dur="4.24">over the time that i was trying to</text><text start="736.959" dur="4.481">collect this data so i think i actually</text><text start="739.12" dur="4.56">got better at shuffling while i was</text><text start="741.44" dur="4.48">doing this experiment it didn&amp;#39;t matter</text><text start="743.68" dur="4.88">that much though because as i added more</text><text start="745.92" dur="5.359">and more data a gorgeous straight line</text><text start="748.56" dur="4.64">appeared on my semi-log plot indicating</text><text start="751.279" dur="5.201">that the distribution of interleaved</text><text start="753.2" dur="5.28">runs was perfectly randomly distributed</text><text start="756.48" dur="4.479">just like the wait times between geiger</text><text start="758.48" dur="4.799">ticks i honestly was not expecting it to</text><text start="760.959" dur="4.161">come out that cleanly it&amp;#39;s really nice</text><text start="763.279" dur="4.321">and linear</text><text start="765.12" dur="4.719">now in order to calculate the likelihood</text><text start="767.6" dur="5.039">of executing a perfect pharaoh shuffle</text><text start="769.839" dur="5.44">by accident all we need to do is</text><text start="772.639" dur="5.2">extrapolate by lifting this plot up</text><text start="775.279" dur="5.441">until we get a single run of 52</text><text start="777.839" dur="5.921">interleaved cards and by that method</text><text start="780.72" dur="5.76">you&amp;#39;d need about 900 000 shuffles to</text><text start="783.76" dur="4.96">produce a single perfect shuffle but</text><text start="786.48" dur="3.919">that&amp;#39;s not actually an unattainable</text><text start="788.72" dur="3.679">number i mean if you think about the</text><text start="790.399" dur="3.521">number of times that a deck of cards</text><text start="792.399" dur="3.041">might be shuffled i mean every time you</text><text start="793.92" dur="3.68">shuffle a deck of cards you actually</text><text start="795.44" dur="3.92">shuffle it a bunch of times if you think</text><text start="797.6" dur="3.919">of all the people in the world that</text><text start="799.36" dur="5.039">might shuffle cards on a daily basis</text><text start="801.519" dur="5.201">this is absolutely going to happen also</text><text start="804.399" dur="4.961">the people that shuffle cards a lot</text><text start="806.72" dur="4.799">probably have a much smaller expected</text><text start="809.36" dur="4.8">number here because like i said</text><text start="811.519" dur="4.88">i got better at shuffling cards over</text><text start="814.16" dur="4.4">these hundred shuffles that i shuffled</text><text start="816.399" dur="5.44">and measured and counted and logged and</text><text start="818.56" dur="6.56">if i only include the last 35 shuffles</text><text start="821.839" dur="4.961">of my 107 shuffles presumably once i was</text><text start="825.12" dur="3.68">warmed up and my average length of</text><text start="826.8" dur="3.92">interleaved runs was higher the math</text><text start="828.8" dur="4.479">says i would need almost an order of</text><text start="830.72" dur="4.64">magnitude fewer shuffles to</text><text start="833.279" dur="5.201">statistically reach a perfectly</text><text start="835.36" dur="5.52">interleaved run 52 cards long so these</text><text start="838.48" dur="4.479">numbers are very fragile but i would say</text><text start="840.88" dur="4.16">at a rough order of magnitude we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="842.959" dur="4.161">looking at hundreds of thousands of</text><text start="845.04" dur="4.479">shuffles to accidentally get a fair</text><text start="847.12" dur="5.04">shuffle but do we trust this number</text><text start="849.519" dur="6.161">what&amp;#39;s this number actually telling us</text><text start="852.16" dur="5.919">it&amp;#39;s saying that runs of 52 cards in a</text><text start="855.68" dur="4.08">row are likely it doesn&amp;#39;t say anything</text><text start="858.079" dur="4.481">about the fact that the deck only</text><text start="859.76" dur="5.36">contains 52 cards this method is</text><text start="862.56" dur="4.24">actually most valid for an extremely</text><text start="865.12" dur="3.2">thick deck of cards where you&amp;#39;re just</text><text start="866.8" dur="3.68">shuffling and shuffling and shuffling</text><text start="868.32" dur="4.8">and shuffling and somewhere within that</text><text start="870.48" dur="5.44">massive stack you end up with a run of</text><text start="873.12" dur="4.8">52. that&amp;#39;s all this math is telling us</text><text start="875.92" dur="4.32">for sure edge effects make it</text><text start="877.92" dur="4.56">significantly messier i had actually</text><text start="880.24" dur="5.52">anticipated this probability curving</text><text start="882.48" dur="5.039">down sort of sub exponential decay that</text><text start="885.76" dur="4.16">i don&amp;#39;t know was that a thing as i got</text><text start="887.519" dur="4.88">to higher lengths of runs i assumed that</text><text start="889.92" dur="4.8">i would frequently interrupt long runs</text><text start="892.399" dur="5.12">with the edge of the deck like if i had</text><text start="894.72" dur="5.04">a run of 10 that was right on the top is</text><text start="897.519" dur="5.281">that actually part of a longer run like</text><text start="899.76" dur="5.36">a 12 or a 14 maybe that extends out the</text><text start="902.8" dur="5.52">top of the stack i mean by this logic</text><text start="905.12" dur="5.6">you&amp;#39;d have to reach a run of 52 and get</text><text start="908.32" dur="4.639">that run to start exactly on the top of</text><text start="910.72" dur="5.04">the deck naively i&amp;#39;d say that this just</text><text start="912.959" dur="4.801">adds another factor of 52 and then you&amp;#39;d</text><text start="915.76" dur="4.48">need to include the chance of runs</text><text start="917.76" dur="5.199">longer than 52 that extend outside the</text><text start="920.24" dur="5.52">deck but in any case that&amp;#39;s not what i</text><text start="922.959" dur="5.201">saw the reality of shuffling cards does</text><text start="925.76" dur="4.24">have an edge effect but most of the long</text><text start="928.16" dur="4.239">runs that i saw were actually in the</text><text start="930" dur="4.88">center and for some reason the way that</text><text start="932.399" dur="5.201">i shuffle cards the cards at the top and</text><text start="934.88" dur="4.56">bottom of the stack tended to clump up a</text><text start="937.6" dur="4.72">little bit and go down as doubles or</text><text start="939.44" dur="5.199">triples or worse so i&amp;#39;d say that for me</text><text start="942.32" dur="5.04">it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to get a pharaoh</text><text start="944.639" dur="4.88">shuffle accidentally because the edge</text><text start="947.36" dur="4.719">effects when i shuffle cards almost</text><text start="949.519" dur="4.721">completely prohibit me from getting a</text><text start="952.079" dur="4.081">long run that starts at the very top of</text><text start="954.24" dur="3.76">the deck or continues through to the</text><text start="956.16" dur="3.679">very bottom of the deck so where does</text><text start="958" dur="3.6">that leave us well</text><text start="959.839" dur="4.721">probably not going to be executing a</text><text start="961.6" dur="3.84">perfect shuffle by mistake anytime soon</text><text start="964.56" dur="2.639">but</text><text start="965.44" dur="4.24">it&amp;#39;s a lot more achievable in general</text><text start="967.199" dur="4.961">than i thought based on the math</text><text start="969.68" dur="5.04">i also have</text><text start="972.16" dur="4.799">unexpectedly direct evidence that</text><text start="974.72" dur="4.559">practicing shuffling actually makes you</text><text start="976.959" dur="5.041">more likely to get a pharaoh shuffle it</text><text
