dur="3.801">quite the same thing see it&amp;#39;s not just</text><text start="120.88" dur="3.8">death that can remove a president a</text><text start="122.6" dur="4.119">president can resign a president can be</text><text start="124.68" dur="4.24">impeached and a president can be enabled</text><text start="126.719" dur="4.681">to discharge the powers and duties of</text><text start="128.92"

dur="4.319">which they don&amp;#39;t leave the office but</text><text start="141.76" dur="5.04">the VP gets the powers and duties of the</text><text start="144.239" dur="4.64">office and becomes acting president this</text><text start="146.8" dur="3.519">on a tiny scale has happened a few times</text><text start="148.879" dur="3.601">when the president has undergone</text><text start="150.319" dur="4.2">non-trivial surgery a reason for this</text><text start="152.48" dur="4.08">being to ensure nuclear weapons command</text><text start="154.519" dur="3.841">and control is

the</text><text start="160.36" dur="3.84">president power reverts as soon as this</text><text start="162.319" dur="3.761">is over and it will assuming death</text><text start="164.2" dur="4.64">doesn&amp;#39;t make a bedside visit anyway</text><text start="166.08" dur="4.48">inability is a subjective sliding scale</text><text start="168.84" dur="4.24">a president could be

dur="4.239">declare themselves inable or become</text><text start="177.36" dur="4.239">physically inable yet simply refuse to</text><text start="179.519" dur="4">declare it here the 25th amendment</text><text start="181.599" dur="4.681">allows for the vice president to perform</text><text start="183.519" dur="5.121">a kind of gentle coup okay the president</text><text start="186.28" dur="4.319">has 15 top level advisers we will get to</text><text start="188.64" dur="3.48">later if the VP can get a majority of</text><text start="190.599" dur="3.601">advisers to state in writing that</text><text start="192.12" dur="4.039">president is enable the VP gets the</text><text start="194.2" dur="3.399">powers and duties of the office the</text><text start="196.159" dur="3.16">president can challenge this getting a</text><text start="197.599" dur="3.761">moment to try and consolidate keys to</text><text start="199.319" dur="4.401">power but if the VP and advisers</text><text start="201.36" dur="5.439">reaffirm the president is indeed inable</text><text start="203.72" dur="5.56">the VP is acting president and a 21-day</text><text start="206.799" dur="4.881">countdown clock begins what happens next</text><text start="209.28" dur="4.159">is a to Congress if they do nothing when</text><text start="211.68" dur="3.839">the clock Runs Out Presidential Power</text><text start="213.439" dur="4.72">returns to the president but if within</text><text start="215.519" dur="4.761">the 21 days Congress votes with a 23s</text><text start="218.159" dur="4">majority that the president is enable</text><text start="220.28" dur="4.28">then the vice president is permanently</text><text start="222.159" dur="5.72">acting president and the president is</text><text start="224.56" dur="5.48">still around awkward obviously this</text><text start="227.879" dur="4.481">would be a real delicate maneuver for</text><text start="230.04" dur="4.399">any VP to pull off particularly as the</text><text start="232.36" dur="3.959">president can dismiss their advisers for</text><text start="234.439" dur="3.841">any reason as long as the president</text><text start="236.319" dur="4.601">holds the powers and duties of the</text><text start="238.28" dur="5.64">office so getting ADV ERS on board would</text><text start="240.92" dur="4.36">be challenging case in point in 1919 the</text><text start="243.92" dur="3.519">president suffered a stroke and was</text><text start="245.28" dur="4.2">mostly blinded and partly paralyzed</text><text start="247.439" dur="3.88">don&amp;#39;t worry no big deal the president</text><text start="249.48" dur="3.839">just doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk to the public</text><text start="251.319" dur="4.2">or meet with his VP or consult with his</text><text start="253.319" dur="4.401">advisers or leave the White House at all</text><text start="255.519" dur="4.481">for a year and a half and during this</text><text start="257.72" dur="4.359">time there was no move by the VP to</text><text start="260" dur="4.8">declare the president enabled but there</text><text start="262.079" dur="4.521">might be a way around the VP the 25th</text><text start="264.8" dur="4.28">has this line about Congress appointing</text><text start="266.6" dur="4.36">like its own committee to determine the</text><text start="269.08" dur="4.559">president in enable but the way it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="270.96" dur="5.64">worded is a little unclear does it mean</text><text start="273.639" dur="4.921">the VP and advisers or congress</text><text start="276.6" dur="5.24">committee determine in ability or does</text><text start="278.56" dur="5.44">it mean the VPN advisers or congress</text><text start="281.84" dur="4.52">committee if the latter interpretation</text><text start="284" dur="4.6">that means Congress alone has the power</text><text start="286.36" dur="4.44">to appoint a committee with the power to</text><text start="288.6" dur="4.76">remove the power of the president</text><text start="290.8" dur="4.52">unilaterally but as always with unclear</text><text start="293.36" dur="3.839">interpretations were they to happen for</text><text start="295.32" dur="4.92">realsies someone might want to weigh in</text><text start="297.199" dur="5.321">on it so those are the four or five ways</text><text start="300.24" dur="4">a president can get removed from office</text><text start="302.52" dur="3.399">but one of them is clearly the most</text><text start="304.24" dur="3.32">popular so let&amp;#39;s talk about what the</text><text start="305.919" dur="3.521">finished Congressional homework says</text><text start="307.56" dur="3.72">about succession first the doubt that</text><text start="309.44" dur="4">began with President 10 is dispelled by</text><text start="311.28" dur="4.08">the 25th when the president dies the</text><text start="313.44" dur="4.52">vice president becomes the president</text><text start="315.36" dur="5.279">president in able equals VP acting</text><text start="317.96" dur="5">president dead equals VP president</text><text start="320.639" dur="4.081">president but if both the president and</text><text start="322.96" dur="3.88">the vice role sevens the order of</text><text start="324.72" dur="3.8">succession is set and first up is the</text><text start="326.84" dur="2.84">speaker who is the elected leader from</text><text start="328.52" dur="3">within the house of represent</text><text start="329.68" dur="3.72">resentatives and next is the president</text><text start="331.52" dur="3.6">prot tempor of the Senate who is the</text><text start="333.4" dur="4">longest serving Senator not</text><text start="335.12" dur="3.799">automatically but elected by tradition</text><text start="337.4" dur="2.96">see that&amp;#39;s a funny thing to mention now</text><text start="338.919" dur="3.521">I&amp;#39;m sure it won&amp;#39;t matter later Senators</text><text start="340.36" dur="3.959">tend to serve for a long time so the</text><text start="342.44" dur="5.12">president prot tempori is often in their</text><text start="344.319" dur="5.041">80s with the record holder being 98 just</text><text start="347.56" dur="3.56">worth noting it was up to Congress to</text><text start="349.36" dur="3.279">set succession order and Congress just</text><text start="351.12" dur="3.4">so happened to pick the two most</text><text start="352.639" dur="3.921">powerful members of Congress as next in</text><text start="354.52" dur="4.04">line from the VP after Congress</text><text start="356.56" dur="4">succession moves to the cabinet these</text><text start="358.56" dur="4.24">are the advisers mentioned before each</text><text start="360.56" dur="4.479">here has the title of secretary and are</text><text start="362.8" dur="3.92">Secretary of a same name Department</text><text start="365.039" dur="3.361">explaining each in detail would take too</text><text start="366.72" dur="3.759">long because it would be to explain the</text><text start="368.4" dur="4.32">entire structure of the executive branch</text><text start="370.479" dur="4.12">which is enormous and some of their</text><text start="372.72" dur="3.84">names give you the idea but some of them</text><text start="374.599" dur="3.521">don&amp;#39;t for example number four in line</text><text start="376.56" dur="3">the Secretary of State who runs the</text><text start="378.12" dur="2.76">Department of State which has nothing to</text><text start="379.56" dur="3.28">do with the states but everything</text><text start="380.88" dur="3.64">outside the states the secretary of</text><text start="382.84" dur="3">state is first in the cabinet because</text><text start="384.52" dur="2.92">managing the Foreign Relations of the</text><text start="385.84" dur="3.16">federal government is a pretty big deal</text><text start="387.44" dur="3.24">that requires you to be on at least</text><text start="389" dur="3.88">decent speed leing terms with other</text><text start="390.68" dur="3.84">countries a good thing should say you</text><text start="392.88" dur="3.439">need their support during a sudden</text><text

dur="4.081">fancy pants here wants to be called the</text><text start="406.12" dur="3.639">attorney general but just so happens to</text><text start="408.28" dur="3.16">be in charge of the Department of</text><text start="409.759" dur="4.081">Justice so the oldest departments have</text><text start="411.44" dur="3.96">their secretaries in 4567 order of</text><text start="413.84" dur="3.079">succession now from here Congress</text><text start="415.4" dur="4.32">decided the rest should continue on</text><text start="416.919" dur="4.72">seniority not for people but Department</text><text start="419.72" dur="3.919">ments which has led to an interesting</text><text start="421.639" dur="4.041">order Secretary of the Interior is next</text><text start="423.639" dur="3.96">up because in the 1800s Young America</text><text start="425.68" dur="3.6">realized she had a lot of interior land</text><text start="427.599" dur="3.44">to manage and created the
