dur="3.92">Imagination since both use many of the</text><text start="65" dur="5.479">same parts of the</text><text start="66.6" dur="5.72">brain in 1910 psychologist Mary perky</text><text start="70.479" dur="4.28">was trying to develop a scientific</text><text start="72.32" dur="4.799">definition of imagination so she devised</text><text start="74.759" dur="4.761">an experiment that produced a surprising</text><text start="77.119" dur="4.68">result test subjects were asked to stare</text><text start="79.52" dur="5.08">at a blank wall and imagine a certain</text><text start="81.799" dur="4.561">fruit meanwhile behind the scenes perky</text><text start="84.6" dur="3.92">projected a very faint image of the</text><text start="86.36" dur="4">fruit on the wall when asked if they saw</text><text start="88.52" dur="3.879">anything real the particip ipants were</text><text start="90.36" dur="3.6">sure they hadn&amp;#39;t although they commented</text><text start="92.399" dur="4.04">on how Vivid the image they were</text><text start="93.96" dur="4.36">imagining seemed perky concluded that</text><text start="96.439" dur="3.761">when our perception of something matches</text><text start="98.32" dur="4.04">what we&amp;#39;re imagining we will assume</text><text start="100.2" dur="4.959">we&amp;#39;ve imagined it this would eventually</text><text start="102.36" dur="4.719">come to be known as the perky effect</text><text start="105.159" dur="4">since then there&amp;#39;s been a handful of</text><text start="107.079" dur="3.64">studies that try to replicate it but</text><text start="109.159" dur="3.121">results were very mixed but now in the</text><text start="110.719" dur="3.72">last decades kind of with the</text><text start="112.28" dur="4.119">advancement of neuroimaging we&amp;#39;ve shown</text><text start="114.439" dur="4.201">time and time again that when we imagine</text><text start="116.399" dur="4.32">something many of the same brain uh</text><text start="118.64" dur="4.32">processes be become involed as when we</text><text start="120.719" dur="4.36">would actually see that same thing so</text><text start="122.96" dur="4.479">Dyer and her team designed an updated</text><text start="125.079" dur="4.281">version of Perky&amp;#39;s experiment the setup</text><text start="127.439" dur="4.481">was similar but to better control for</text><text start="129.36" dur="4.28">the variability in imagined objects the</text><text start="131.92" dur="4.319">researchers asked participants to</text><text start="133.64" dur="5.12">imagine something more specific diagonal</text><text start="136.239" dur="4.36">lines participants stared at a static</text><text start="138.76" dur="4.759">screen and were asked to imagine the</text><text start="140.599" dur="5.841">lines just as in Perky&amp;#39;s experiment</text><text start="143.519" dur="4.8">faint images would appear and disappear</text><text start="146.44" dur="4.28">what we found was actually kind of</text><text start="148.319" dur="5.121">surprising because we did did not find a</text><text start="150.72" dur="5.96">perky effect instead in results</text><text start="153.44" dur="5.519">published in 2023 a more nuanced picture</text><text start="156.68" dur="4.12">emerged when the researchers asked</text><text start="158.959" dur="4.801">participants if the lines they saw were</text><text start="160.8" dur="4.799">real or imagined the responses varied</text><text start="163.76" dur="4.16">when they were shown faint images of the</text><text start="165.599" dur="4.28">lines participants were more likely to</text><text start="167.92" dur="4.319">report seeing them and when they weren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="169.879" dur="4.201">shown the lines some still reported</text><text start="172.239" dur="4.121">seeing them suggesting vivid</text><text start="174.08" dur="5.04">imaginations at work so taken together</text><text start="176.36" dur="4.48">what we can kind of conclude from this</text><text start="179.12" dur="5.039">is that when imagination gets really</text><text start="180.84" dur="5">Vivid it can be mistaken for reality so</text><text start="184.159" dur="3.841">the way that we are thinking about this</text><text start="185.84" dur="5.92">now is that this is all to do with</text><text start="188" dur="6.04">sensory strength unlike perky Dyer went</text><text start="191.76" dur="4.68">beyond first-person reporting she and</text><text start="194.04" dur="3.96">her collaborators analyzed neuroimaging</text><text start="196.44" dur="4">data from the participants in their</text><text start="198" dur="5">study what they saw suggests that the</text><text start="200.44" dur="4.439">visual and prefrontal cortices may be</text><text start="203" dur="4.92">directly involved in the process of</text><text start="204.879" dur="5.92">distinguishing imagination from reality</text><text start="207.92" dur="4.8">so I intuitively always thought it was</text><text start="210.799" dur="3.881">going to be more like a switch but the</text><text start="212.72" dur="3.4">research seems to suggest that it might</text><text start="214.68" dur="4.759">be more like a</text><text start="216.12" dur="6.56">gradual meter but then the way you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="219.439" dur="5">interpreting this is more binary so like</text><text start="222.68" dur="4.08">once it crosses some threshold you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="224.439" dur="4.241">like oh now it&amp;#39;s real and before that</text><text start="226.76" dur="4.039">it&amp;#39;s not real and that point is what we</text><text start="228.68" dur="4.119">call the reality threshold and they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="230.799" dur="4.44">basically saying that the way that we</text><text start="232.799" dur="4.601">distinguish what is seen versus what is</text><text start="235.239" dur="4.64">imagined that the strength of this</text><text start="237.4" dur="5.24">representation has to exceed a threshold</text><text start="239.879" dur="4.121">for us to consider it real or out there</text><text start="242.64" dur="3.2">in the world and that&amp;#39;s something that</text><text start="244" dur="4">we&amp;#39;re really Keen to investigate further</text><text start="245.84" dur="3.8">whether we can get measures of this in</text><text start="248" dur="3.4">individual people and then see if that</text><text start="249.64" dur="5.08">relates to things like hallucination</text><text start="251.4" dur="5.2">proness or schizophrenia or sometimes in</text><text start="254.72" dur="4.079">Parkinson&amp;#39;s people experience these</text><text start="256.6" dur="4.08">really Vivid hallucinations that are</text><text start="258.799" dur="5.081">actually imaginations but they feel real</text><text start="260.68" dur="4.68">to these people so one hypothesis would</text><text start="263.88" dur="3.879">be that something is wrong in their</text><text start="265.36" dur="3.76">reality threshold the more I learn the</text><text start="267.759" dur="3.841">more questions I have and the more I</text><text start="269.12" dur="2.48">want to keep going</text><text start="273.96" dur="5.079">humans are made of nearly 70 trillion</text><text start="276.639" dur="5.521">cells but only half of them are truly</text><text start="279.039" dur="5.081">ours the other half are foreign microbes</text><text

dur="6.16">other germs so we say a microbiome but</text><text start="307.8" dur="6.08">this means many different species</text><text start="310.6" dur="6.12">hundreds to thousands so it&amp;#39;s not just</text><text start="313.88" dur="5.56">studying one pathogen we have to study</text><text start="316.72" dur="5.319">so many microorganisms all of them are</text><text start="319.44"

dur="4.88">lifetime this year a team of biologists</text><text start="355.56" dur="4.199">at the University of trento in Italy</text><text start="357.6" dur="4.719">developed new ways to trace gen gentic</text><text start="359.759" dur="5.28">strains of microbes as they pass between</text><text start="362.319" dur="5.481">individuals so we try to collect as many</text><text start="365.039"

the</text><text start="372.039" dur="5.361">planet we collected more than 9,000</text><text start="375.08" dur="5.36">samples for the gut and the or</text><text start="377.4" dur="6.04">microbiome so stool and saliva samples</text><text start="380.44" dur="5.12">in more than 30 different countries we</text><text start="383.44" dur="4.36">just sequence all the DNA that is there</text><text start="385.56" dur="4.24">in the sample the challenge here is to</text><text start="387.8" dur="3.6">make sense of the sequencing data</text><text start="389.8" dur="4.119">considering that we are not looking at</text><text start="391.4" dur="5.199">one individual but a community of</text><text start="393.919" dur="4.801">individuals all together comparing the</text><text start="396.599" dur="4.401">individuals data across familial and</text><text start="398.72" dur="4.08">social networks the researchers wanted</text><text start="401" dur="4.08">to know if microorganisms in the</text><text start="402.8" dur="5.32">microbiome could spread from person to</text><text start="405.08" dur="5.48">person like a cold or a stomach bug and</text><text start="408.12" dur="4.4">what they found suggests that microbes</text><text start="410.56" dur="4.039">hop much more extensively than we</text><text start="412.52" dur="4.92">thought between people in close physical</text><text start="414.599" dur="5.32">proximity like roommates spouses and</text><text start="417.44" dur="5.159">children the power of our study was</text><text start="419.919" dur="5.12">really that what we saw was</text><text start="422.599" dur="4.241">consistent across all these populations</text><text start="425.039" dur="4.28">and and and different Lifestyles there</text><text start="426.84" dur="4.72">is really a massive transmission of</text><text start="429.319" dur="5.041">human microbiome members directly</text><text start="431.56" dur="6.28">through social interaction so our social</text><text start="434.36" dur="6.04">activity impact our microbiome which in</text><text start="437.84" dur="4.28">Impact our biology so the way and the</text><text start="440.4" dur="4.479">people we are interacting with is</text><text start="442.12" dur="5.359">impacting also our biology our medical</text><text start="444.879" dur="5.241">history I think it warrants additional</text><text start="447.479" dur="5.201">study into the Dynamics and the sources</text><text start="450.12" dur="5.16">and the the full range of sources where</text><text start="452.68" dur="5.68">these organisms come from but this is a</text><text start="455.28" dur="6.039">huge uh step in understanding the</text><text start="458.36" dur="5.64">transmission landscape as humans evolved</text><text start="461.319" dur="5.361">our microbiomes may have evolved with us</text><text start="464" dur="4.639">to protect our health and Immunity but</text><text start="466.68" dur="4.32">with the continued use of antibiotics</text><text start="468.639" dur="4.201">and antiseptics in the modern world we</text><text start="471" dur="4.479">may be throwing off our

start="478" dur="4.319">more we study it the more we realize</text><text start="479.72" dur="5">that the microbiome underlies a lot of</text><text start="482.319" dur="4.521">different uh immune Related Disorders in</text><text start="484.72" dur="4.24">the body so many of these are chronic</text><text start="486.84" dur="4.759">conditions things like cancers</text><text start="488.96" dur="5.48">autoimmunity inflammatory bowel disease</text><text start="491.599" dur="5.6">and diabetes multiple sclerosis and many</text><text start="494.44" dur="5.08">other disorders and so we typically</text><text start="497.199" dur="4.041">didn&amp;#39;t understand the root causes of</text><text start="499.52" dur="3.519">those diseases but as we explore them</text><text start="501.24" dur="3.679">more they&amp;#39;re not only genetic and</text><text start="503.039" dur="3.321">environmental but they have a lot to do</text><text start="504.919" dur="4.361">with these organisms that live within</text><text start="506.36" dur="5.239">our body we cannot really infer uh</text><text start="509.28" dur="4.48">causality so we don&amp;#39;t know if the</text><text start="511.599"

dur="4.76">same way but then something strange</text><text start="537.44" dur="5.839">happens the human embryo development</text><text start="539.76" dur="6.96">slows down and the mouses</text><text start="543.279" dur="6.201">accelerates as far as we can tell every</text><text start="546.72" dur="6.679">step takes about two to three times</text><text start="549.48" dur="6.16">longer in the human
