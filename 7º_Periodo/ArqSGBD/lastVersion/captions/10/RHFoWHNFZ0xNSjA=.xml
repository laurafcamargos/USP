dur="4.56">more water in one end of the pipe water</text><text start="168.72" dur="4.2">has to come out of the other end of the</text><text start="170.519" dur="4.86">pipe immediately because

dur="5.699">but if I push on the end of this beam</text><text start="217.68" dur="5.82">the other end moves too right away and I</text><text start="221.099" dur="4.621">can use this to transmit Force

start="267.36" dur="5.119">really know how they fit in like gravity</text><text start="269.1" dur="5.7">and solve all of those equations</text><text start="272.479" dur="3.881">simultaneously so imagine how many atoms</text><text start="274.8" dur="3.48">there are in this bar are how many</text><text start="276.36" dur="4.32">particles there are in each atom that</text><text start="278.28" dur="5.1">many equations with you know a few</text><text start="280.68" dur="5.4">unknowns each and uh solve them all at</text><text start="283.38" dur="5.039">once easy right there&amp;#39;s no way that</text><text start="286.08" dur="4.14">you&amp;#39;re ever ever ever even going to come</text><text start="288.419" dur="3.901">close to solve that equation there&amp;#39;s no</text><text

this sitting on a</text><text start="297.24" dur="4.38">table there&amp;#39;s just no way so how do we</text><text start="299.04" dur="6.06">ever actually do physics if we can&amp;#39;t do</text><text start="301.62" dur="6.12">physics accurately well we approximate</text><text start="305.1" dur="4.8">so at the other end of the spectrum from</text><text start="307.74" dur="4.739">the really really complicated quantum</text><text start="309.9" dur="4.739">mechanical description we have the rigid</text><text start="312.479" dur="5.341">body approximation and Newton&amp;#39;s loss of</text><text start="314.639" dur="5.821">motion and then it&amp;#39;s really easy to say</text><text start="317.82" dur="5.099">this is one object this object has a</text><text start="320.46" dur="5.82">mass I apply a certain amount of force</text><text start="322.919" dur="5.761">which makes this object accelerate and</text><text start="326.28" dur="4.919">we can even model the force of gravity</text><text start="328.68" dur="4.859">as a single force on this object and we</text><text start="331.199" dur="4.861">can model the friction against the table</text><text start="333.539" dur="4.321">as a single force acting on this object</text><text start="336.06" dur="4.139">and with</text><text start="337.86" dur="6.3">math that is no more complicated than</text><text start="340.199" dur="6.601">pen and paper math you can with great</text><text start="344.16" dur="4.74">accuracy describe what&amp;#39;s going to happen</text><text start="346.8" dur="4.26">to this bar when I push it across the</text><text start="348.9" dur="3.6">table and that&amp;#39;s because all that</text><text start="351.06" dur="3.419">quantum mechanical stuff just sort of</text><text start="352.5" dur="4.62">averages out and doesn&amp;#39;t matter in the</text><text start="354.479" dur="5">final result but that approximation also</text><text start="357.12" dur="4.74">says that the other end of the bar moves</text><text start="359.479" dur="4.181">instantaneously when I push on this end</text><text start="361.86" dur="3.42">of the bar and if you try to combine</text><text start="363.66" dur="3.3">that with other pieces of physics like</text><text start="365.28" dur="3.78">relativity and the fact that the speed</text><text start="366.96" dur="5.28">of light shouldn&amp;#39;t really allow that to</text><text start="369.06" dur="5.699">happen it starts to be weird so</text><text start="372.24" dur="4.92">let&amp;#39;s do the experiment now is your last</text><text start="374.759" dur="5.16">chance to update your guests is that</text><text start="377.16" dur="6.06">delay zero seconds if it&amp;#39;s an ideal</text><text start="379.919" dur="6.081">solid object three nanoseconds if the</text><text start="383.22" dur="5.46">speed of light is relevant 180</text><text start="386" dur="4.979">microseconds if the speed of sound is</text><text start="388.68" dur="4.92">relevant or about three and a half</text><text start="390.979" dur="4.72">milliseconds if the speed of the hammer</text><text start="393.6" dur="4.2">and the yield strain of the steel are</text><text start="395.699" dur="4.44">relevant okay so of course this is</text><text start="397.8" dur="4.56">scaled down from the 300 000 kilometer</text><text start="400.139" dur="4.081">long beam but 91 centimeters is a little</text><text start="402.36" dur="4.38">easier to work with I have it sitting</text><text start="404.22" dur="4.8">here on the table pushed up against a</text><text start="406.74" dur="3.899">force sensor you can see that the the</text><text start="409.02" dur="4.5">yellow tray sort of freaks out when I</text><text start="410.639" dur="5.221">push it against this this backstop</text><text start="413.52" dur="5.34">and on the other side here I have a wire</text><text start="415.86" dur="5.16">clamped to it and this wire is actually</text><text start="418.86" dur="4.14">attached to a battery or resistor and a</text><text start="421.02" dur="3.239">hammer such that when I make contact</text><text start="423" dur="3.539">with the wire</text><text start="424.259" dur="3.241">there&amp;#39;s actually a circuit completed</text><text start="426.539" dur="3.481">here</text><text start="427.5" dur="4.919">the moment that this Hammer actually</text><text start="430.02" dur="5.579">touches the metal bar if I hit the metal</text><text start="432.419" dur="6.9">bar here that&amp;#39;s going to start our timer</text><text start="435.599" dur="6.361">of sorts and then as soon as this</text><text start="439.319" dur="4.621">pressure sensor detects that the bar is</text><text start="441.96" dur="4.019">actually pushing into it as in the whole</text><text start="443.94" dur="4.08">bar has moved a little bit and pushed</text><text start="445.979" dur="4.5">into the pressure sensor that&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="448.02" dur="6.48">stop our timer and we&amp;#39;ll know exactly</text><text start="450.479" dur="6.12">how long it takes for motion or Force to</text><text start="454.5" dur="6.06">get from this end of the bar to that end</text><text start="456.599" dur="7.581">of the bar so without further ado</text><text start="460.56" dur="3.62">zero out the cursors</text><text start="469.08" dur="6">here we go first of all there is a delay</text><text start="472.56" dur="5.28">which is interesting in and of itself it</text><text start="475.08" dur="4.86">means that this metal bar is not an</text><text start="477.84" dur="4.199">ideal rigid body that you would use in</text><text start="479.94" dur="4.56">like freshman physics because this end</text><text start="482.039" dur="5.461">of the bar can move when this end of the</text><text start="484.5" dur="5.22">bar isn&amp;#39;t moving so this end of the bar</text><text start="487.5" dur="5.52">starts to move when this blue Trace goes</text><text start="489.72" dur="5.159">from low to high right here and then you</text><text start="493.02" dur="4.2">can see that the yellow Trace is pretty</text><text start="494.879" dur="5.16">much flat and then all of a sudden it</text><text start="497.22" dur="4.919">spikes way up and that Spike up is when</text><text start="500.039" dur="5.041">the bar starts to push</text><text start="502.139" dur="5.641">into the backstop at the far end and if</text><text start="505.08" dur="6.299">I actually measure that out very first</text><text start="507.78" dur="5.96">bit of signal is at a hundred and</text><text start="511.379" dur="6.061">wow it is exactly</text><text start="513.74" dur="6.159">180 microseconds which I believe is the</text><text start="517.44" dur="3.8">answer that I put at the beginning of</text><text start="519.899" dur="3.961">the video script</text><text start="521.24" dur="4.36">that couldn&amp;#39;t be more perfect so what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="523.86" dur="3.539">the speed of sound in the bar</text><text start="525.6" dur="4.38">so you can see that the hammer itself</text><text start="527.399" dur="5.701">only actually makes contact for about</text><text start="529.98" dur="5.52">150 160 microseconds and then that</text><text start="533.1" dur="4.32">current falls off again but the yellow</text><text start="535.5" dur="3.899">line is what we care about in terms of</text><text start="537.42" dur="4.38">the actual Force at the far end of the</text><text start="539.399" dur="3.961">bar and if I zoom in on on the yellow</text><text start="541.8" dur="3.719">line I&amp;#39;ll make the Blue Line go away</text><text start="543.36" dur="3.72">here we&amp;#39;re basically plotting the force</text><text start="545.519" dur="5.401">that the bar exerts on that pressure</text><text start="547.08" dur="5.22">sensor versus time and as we go along</text><text start="550.92" dur="4.44">we&amp;#39;re going along we&amp;#39;re going along</text><text start="552.3" dur="6.9">there&amp;#39;s no force on it whatsoever</text><text start="555.36" dur="7.56">and then here at about uh</text><text start="559.2" dur="5.94">uh what is this like 190 microseconds or</text><text start="562.92" dur="4.08">so it starts to tick up and we get this</text><text start="565.14" dur="4.319">positive force that says the sensor is</text><text start="567" dur="4.26">being really completely compressed and</text><text start="569.459" dur="5.101">that&amp;#39;s when the bar has actually started</text><text start="571.26" dur="5.82">to move and it&amp;#39;s pushing into the sensor</text><text start="574.56" dur="4.44">now you&amp;#39;ll notice that I measured from</text><text start="577.08" dur="4.08">over here because this little negative</text><text start="579" dur="3.779">blip is an artifact of how Those sensors</text><text start="581.16" dur="3.42">actually measure and when you&amp;#39;re only</text><text start="582.779" dur="3.541">compressing part of the sensor rather</text><text start="584.58" dur="3.12">than the whole thing it actually goes</text><text start="586.32" dur="2.94">negative for a minute I think it has to</text><text start="587.7" dur="4.5">do with the capacitance I&amp;#39;ll talk about</text><text start="589.26" dur="4.019">that at the end but regardless uh this</text><text start="592.2" dur="4.319">is</text><text start="593.279" dur="5.101">starting to feel a force exactly 180</text><text start="596.519" dur="3.601">microseconds after the initial impulse</text><text start="598.38" dur="5.04">with the hammer so this is sort of like</text><text start="600.12" dur="5.88">the speed of motion in the bar and the</text><text start="603.42" dur="4.8">velocity of this bar is in homogeneous</text><text start="606" dur="5.82">the whole thing is not actually a solid</text><text start="608.22" dur="6.179">object so information about the velocity</text><text start="611.82" dur="4.38">of this bar is not transmitted</text><text start="614.399" dur="3.841">instantaneously to all of the atoms in</text><text start="616.2" dur="4.139">the bar at the same time so why was I so</text><text start="618.24" dur="4.44">excited to run this experiment and how</text><text start="620.339" dur="4.261">did I predict what the answer was going</text><text start="622.68" dur="4.08">to be at least</text><text start="624.6" dur="3.96">a close enough prediction that I knew</text><text start="626.76" dur="4.139">that I&amp;#39;d be able to physically measure</text><text start="628.56" dur="3.779">the answer uh given this setup before</text><text start="630.899" dur="2.701">going out and buying a whole bunch of</text><text start="632.339" dur="2.821">Steel and buying a bunch of pressure</text><text start="633.6" dur="5.58">transducers I wanted to know what was</text><text start="635.16" dur="7.32">possible and

start="646.26" dur="5.88">models for various situations in this</text><text start="649.38" dur="5.04">case because I wanted to do this with</text><text start="652.14" dur="4.62">something like a bar of Steel the first</text><text start="654.42" dur="4.859">thing that came to my mind as a material</text><text start="656.76" dur="5.759">scientist was the atomic structure of</text><text

start="901.92" dur="3.96">a wire and this equivalence came up</text><text start="904.079" dur="4.981">while I was thinking about comments on</text><text start="905.88" dur="5.88">my last video I love

dur="5.64">Machinery can be recycled now as to the</text><text start="916.56" dur="4.86">actual physical test why the mess I</text><text start="919.56" dur="3.839">initially wanted to just set a</text><text start="921.42" dur="3.659">piezoelectric sensor at both ends of the</text><text start="923.399" dur="4.5">rod so the rod was sandwiched between</text><text start="925.079" dur="5.521">them and hit the stack compressing them</text><text start="927.899" dur="4.201">both at once it&amp;#39;s cleaner to explain and</text><text start="930.6" dur="3.539">any delay of the sensor would be</text><text start="932.1" dur="4.38">replicated on both sides so it felt like</text><text start="934.139" dur="4.741">a great Simple Solution unfortunately it</text><text start="936.48" dur="3.96">was also really bad because every time I</text><text start="938.88" dur="3.48">hit the sensor I&amp;#39;d get this weird</text><text start="940.44" dur="4.86">negative signal before the disc actually</text><text start="942.36" dur="6">compressed also and more important the</text><text start="945.3" dur="4.62">time delay was widely varying my first</text><text start="948.36" dur="3.779">thought was that the sensors weren&amp;#39;t</text><text start="949.92" dur="4.14">completely pushed up against the bar so</text><text start="952.139" dur="4.081">I actually super glued them to the ends</text><text start="954.06" dur="4.56">of the bar but that weirdly enough</text><text start="956.22" dur="3.9">didn&amp;#39;t fix either problem the</text><text start="958.62" dur="3.779">measurements were still all over the</text><text start="960.12" dur="4.2">place and I ended up lasering out a</text><text start="962.399" dur="3.781">couple of little acrylic discs in</text><text start="964.32" dur="4.68">sandwiching the Piezo sensors between</text><text start="966.18" dur="4.68">them now the entire disc was securely</text><text start="969" dur="4.019">squished sort of at once the weird</text><text start="970.86" dur="4.919">negative pre-signal was a lot smaller</text><text start="973.019" dur="4.74">but the time delay is still all over the</text><text start="975.779" dur="4.201">place after the second day of this</text><text start="977.759" dur="4.32">trying different bars and different</text><text start="979.98" dur="3.96">sensor arrangements and whatnot I</text><text start="982.079" dur="3.781">finally gave up and then had a literal</text><text start="983.94" dur="4.019">shower thought the next morning that the</text><text start="985.86" dur="4.68">first sensor was probably squishing</text><text start="987.959" dur="4.861">inconsistently and therefore causing an</text><text start="990.54" dur="4.68">inconsistent delay between the hammer</text><text start="992.82" dur="4.319">and the bar so I took it out but I</text><text start="995.22" dur="4.02">needed a new way to get the start time</text><text start="997.139" dur="3.961">and decided that since the bar was metal</text><text start="999.24" dur="3.599">and the hammer was metal I might as well</text><text start="1001.1" dur="4.32">just clip a battery across them and wait</text><text start="1002.839" dur="5.101">for the electrons to flow and uh</text><text start="1005.42" dur="4.859">although it made for a very messy</text><text start="1007.94" dur="4.56">looking table it worked after messing</text><text start="1010.279" dur="4.86">with some variations on the Piezo</text><text start="1012.5" dur="5.399">placement experimenting with some really</text><text start="1015.139" dur="5.64">cloogy foil and tape capacitor sensors</text><text start="1017.899" dur="4.981">and running out of battery Clips I had a</text><text start="1020.779" dur="5.881">consistent result but it was the wrong</text><text start="1022.88" dur="4.799">result and I struggled with this for a</text><text start="1026.66" dur="2.519">while it&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;m getting the same</text><text start="1027.679" dur="4.74">answer every time what could be wrong</text><text start="1029.179" dur="5.64">well maybe it&amp;#39;s the squish of the sensor</text><text start="1032.419" dur="4.38">maybe it&amp;#39;s just slower than I thought so</text><text start="1034.819" dur="4.62">I tried a bunch of different length bars</text><text start="1036.799" dur="5.701">I&amp;#39;ve got a three foot bar a two foot bar</text><text start="1039.439" dur="5.52">and a one foot bar so I put all of these</text><text start="1042.5" dur="4.86">in the exact same setup and they plotted</text><text start="1044.959" dur="4.881">a perfect line down to zero and because</text><text start="1047.36" dur="4.679">the intercept of that line was</text><text start="1049.84" dur="5.02">approximately zero I think it was like</text><text start="1052.039" dur="5.701">negative three microseconds that told me</text><text start="1054.86" dur="5.04">that I didn&amp;#39;t have any sensor Squish and</text><text start="1057.74" dur="4.08">that the delay was actually proportional</text><text start="1059.9" dur="3.84">to the length of the bar but it still</text><text start="1061.82" dur="4.44">wasn&amp;#39;t the correct delay I was getting</text><text start="1063.74" dur="4.38">something in the vicinity of 5 000</text><text start="1066.26" dur="4.56">meters per second for the speed of sound</text><text start="1068.12" dur="6.36">but the velocity that I was looking up</text><text start="1070.82" dur="6.599">the compressive longitudinal wave speed</text><text start="1074.48" dur="4.559">through steel was something like six</text><text start="1077.419" dur="3.541">thousand meters per second and 20</text><text start="1079.039" dur="4.741">percent was too much I did not want to</text><text start="1080.96" dur="4.62">be 20 off for an experiment like this</text><text start="1083.78" dur="3.72">where I should be able to eliminate</text><text start="1085.58" dur="4.92">almost everything because it&amp;#39;s like</text><text start="1087.5" dur="4.98">bench top my first instinct was that it</text><text start="1090.5" dur="5.76">was just a weird formulation of Steel</text><text start="1092.48" dur="6.48">and I looked the speed of sound does</text><text start="1096.26" dur="5.4">vary in steel Alloys but that wasn&amp;#39;t the</text><text start="1098.96" dur="6.3">final answer the issue is that these</text><text start="1101.66" dur="7.2">bars are very small as in the diameter</text><text start="1105.26" dur="5.88">is very small relative to the wavelength</text><text start="1108.86" dur="5.1">of the sound waves passing through the</text><text start="1111.14" dur="5.46">bars in general the speed of sound if</text><text start="1113.96" dur="6">you look at the Springs attached to</text><text start="1116.6" dur="6">weights model is proportional to the</text><text start="1119.96" dur="4.74">strength of the spring and the size of</text><text start="1122.6" dur="4.56">the mass that is at each point along the</text><text start="1124.7" dur="4.859">chain if you make all the masses heavier</text><text start="1127.16" dur="5.22">then the wave propagates more slowly if</text><text start="1129.559" dur="4.801">you make all the Springs stronger then</text><text start="1132.38" dur="5.039">the sound wave propagates more rapidly</text><text start="1134.36" dur="5.46">when you extend these Concepts to an</text><text start="1137.419" dur="6.181">actual chunk of material like one of</text><text start="1139.82" dur="5.4">these steel bars we can&amp;#39;t look at the</text><text start="1143.6" dur="4.38">mass of every atom and the spring</text><text start="1145.22" dur="5.1">constant of Every Spring we have to sort</text><text start="1147.98" dur="4.68">of average these across the material and</text><text start="1150.32" dur="4.68">for an average spring constant you take</text><text start="1152.66" dur="4.62">the Young&amp;#39;s modulus which is basically</text><text start="1155" dur="4.76">how squishy is it and for the average</text><text start="1157.28" dur="6.36">weight of the atoms you take the density</text><text start="1159.76" dur="5.86">the average mass per volume and when you</text><text start="1163.64" dur="3.84">combine those together you can calculate</text><text start="1165.62" dur="3.78">the speed of sound but there&amp;#39;s an</text><text start="1167.48" dur="5.04">important extra parameter in there the</text><text start="1169.4" dur="6.42">poisson ratio which basically says when</text><text start="1172.52" dur="5.279">you squish the bar end to end it</text><text start="1175.82" dur="5.16">actually gets a little bit wider because</text><text start="1177.799" dur="6.481">it those atoms have to go somewhere and</text><text start="1180.98" dur="5.76">as it turns out that has a strong impact</text><text start="1184.28" dur="4.74">on the velocity that a sound wave</text><text start="1186.74" dur="5.52">travels through a material but</text><text start="1189.02" dur="5.94">for a really thin bar like this it</text><text start="1192.26" dur="4.74">actually doesn&amp;#39;t matter because your</text><text start="1194.96" dur="4.079">transmission of the sound wave is</text><text start="1197" dur="4.38">completely one-dimensional the fact that</text><text start="1199.039" dur="4.26">it spreads out just doesn&amp;#39;t have an</text><text start="1201.38" dur="3.48">impact so you get this simpler formula</text><text start="1203.299" dur="3.481">where you basically just have the speed</text><text start="1204.86" dur="4.319">of sound proportional to the square root</text><text start="1206.78" dur="4.2">of the density and the poisson ratio and</text><text start="1209.179" dur="4.201">when you do that math</text><text start="1210.98" dur="4.14">for steel you get the exact same answer</text><text start="1213.38" dur="3.84">that I did with this oscilloscope which</text><text start="1215.12" dur="4.679">made me very happy once I figured it out</text><text start="1217.22" dur="3.9">so I was getting the right answer I just</text><text start="1219.799" dur="2.821">didn&amp;#39;t think I was getting the right</text><text start="1221.12" dur="3.48">answer and it made me question my</text><text start="1222.62" dur="3.66">methods also you can just go look up</text><text start="1224.6" dur="3.42">this one-dimensional speed of sound it</text><text start="1226.28" dur="4.44">turns out it has a name it&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="1228.02" dur="5.279">extensional speed of sound as opposed to</text><text start="1230.72" dur="5.28">the longitudinal speed which would have</text><text start="1233.299" dur="4.62">been correct if I instead had a giant</text><text start="1236" dur="3.84">cube of Steel that was a</text><text start="1237.919"

why solid</text><text start="1245.299" dur="6.36">objects aren&amp;#39;t actually solid objects</text><text start="1248.72" dur="5.64">and also why simple demonstrations can</text><text
