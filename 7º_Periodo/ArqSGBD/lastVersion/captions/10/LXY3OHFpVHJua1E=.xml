start="17.16" dur="5.48">very pleased to be here uh aset said I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="19.6" dur="5.839">the editor of quantum magazine and I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="22.64" dur="5.76">so happy that step strogatz uh is</text><text start="25.439" dur="4.6">joining us tonight to talk all about</text><text start="28.4" dur="4.28">really about his career I mean my goal</text><text start="30.039" dur="5.081">here tonight is to try to take you on a</text><text start="32.68" dur="5">bit of a journey behind the scenes of</text><text start="35.12" dur="5.72">Steve&amp;#39;s Evolution as a mathematician and</text><text start="37.68" dur="6.44">teacher through book writing and public</text><text start="40.84" dur="6.44">speaking and now uh with the podcasts</text><text start="44.12" dur="5.919">that he is hosting for Quant I want to</text><text start="47.28" dur="5.32">start the conversation by talking about</text><text start="50.039" dur="4.801">you as a teacher because I see you</text><text start="52.6" dur="4.32">beyond all of your wonderful research</text><text start="54.84" dur="3.44">and all the books and even all the books</text><text start="56.92" dur="4.4">and all the public speaking that you&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="58.28" dur="4.919">done I see a lot of that at its core as</text><text start="61.32" dur="4.44">a form of teaching first of all why is</text><text start="63.199" dur="5.96">teaching so important to you and what is</text><text start="65.76" dur="5.44">it that you feel like um and I&amp;#39;ll say</text><text start="69.159" dur="3.96">that my my own sense of what makes you</text><text start="71.2" dur="4.12">such a great teacher is a certain level</text><text start="73.119" dur="3.68">of empathy okay because I think that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="75.32" dur="3.479">one thing that separates Great teachers</text><text start="76.799" dur="3.481">and and teachers who maybe you know are</text><text start="78.799" dur="3.121">trying to communicate something but</text><text start="80.28" dur="4.08">maybe less successfully but I want to</text><text start="81.92" dur="4.32">hear from you um why you care as much</text><text start="84.36" dur="3.16">about teaching and what is it that you</text><text start="86.24" dur="3.519">try to do that&amp;#39;s maybe a little bit</text><text start="87.52" dur="4.68">different than wellow Tom you&amp;#39;re bowling</text><text start="89.759" dur="5.121">me over with that introduction and all</text><text start="92.2" dur="4.4">those super kind words thank you yeah</text><text start="94.88" dur="4.32">you&amp;#39;ve really put your finger on things</text><text start="96.6" dur="5.519">that I do care about the word empathy I</text><text start="99.2" dur="5.4">would like to single out because um you</text><text start="102.119" dur="5.32">very astutely I think really hit the</text><text start="104.6" dur="4.559">nail on the head that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="107.439" dur="4.601">the single most important thing in</text><text start="109.159" dur="4.841">teaching and writing um and</text><text start="112.04" dur="4.28">communicating to try to anticipate</text><text start="114" dur="4.799">what&amp;#39;s in the listener&amp;#39;s mind or in the</text><text start="116.32" dur="5.28">reader mind or the students mind if it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="118.799" dur="5.96">a class so</text><text start="121.6" dur="4.6">um I don&amp;#39;t know it&amp;#39;s a really</text><text start="124.759" dur="4.681">interesting question you ask why do I</text><text start="126.2" dur="5.52">care so much about teaching that I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="129.44" dur="5.32">think anyone ever asked me that before</text><text start="131.72" dur="5.239">and I&amp;#39;m not sure I know what I would say</text><text start="134.76" dur="5.16">my instinctive response is because I</text><text start="136.959" dur="5.441">have something delightful and beautiful</text><text start="139.92" dur="5">that I want to show you how are you able</text><text start="142.4" dur="3.8">to strip away what you know because I</text><text start="144.92" dur="4.24">think one of the challenges for people</text><text start="146.2" dur="5.319">who um especially mathematicians who</text><text start="149.16" dur="3.719">know a lot about subject who are very</text><text start="151.519" dur="2.601">precise I mean it&amp;#39;s part of the training</text><text start="152.879" dur="2.481">I think as mathematician is that you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="154.12" dur="2.479">extremely precise you want to be very</text><text start="155.36" dur="3.64">rigorous in the way that you do your</text><text start="156.599" dur="4">mathematics so everything that you say</text><text start="159" dur="3.48">you there&amp;#39;s 10 other statements that you</text><text start="160.599" dur="4.041">have to say to sort of you know make</text><text start="162.48" dur="5.52">that as as precise as possible how are</text><text start="164.64" dur="4.76">you able to both self-edit and put</text><text start="168" dur="2.84">yourself in the shoes of someone who</text><text start="169.4" dur="3.119">doesn&amp;#39;t know the things that you know</text><text start="170.84" dur="4.2">right there&amp;#39;s certain there&amp;#39;s a certain</text><text start="172.519" dur="4.44">curse of knowledge hurdle here that you</text><text start="175.04" dur="3.199">have to be able to say okay this person</text><text start="176.959" dur="2.441">you know doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily know all</text><text start="178.239" dur="3.121">the things I know how do you put</text><text start="179.4" dur="4.28">yourself in issues this feeling of</text><text start="181.36" dur="4.12">bursting and wanting to share something</text><text start="183.68" dur="4.119">can also lead someone to be extremely</text><text start="185.48" dur="5.24">boring right it&amp;#39;s almost the definition</text><text start="187.799" dur="5.241">of a boore someone who is going on and</text><text start="190.72" dur="6.32">on um but you don&amp;#39;t care what they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="193.04" dur="8">talking about and so that&amp;#39;s a key part</text><text start="197.04" dur="6.36">of good teaching or good writing um is</text><text start="201.04" dur="5.119">what you first said empathy that I have</text><text start="203.4" dur="4.72">to but but the specific part of empathy</text><text start="206.159" dur="4.241">I&amp;#39;m talking about here is I have to help</text><text start="208.12" dur="4.64">you love the question</text><text start="210.4" dur="4.68">that&amp;#39;s the classic mistake if if a</text><text start="212.76" dur="4.16">teacher or the writer goes on about look</text><text start="215.08" dur="5.6">at the great way that this problem was</text><text start="216.92" dur="5.84">solved or um so you might spend too much</text><text start="220.68" dur="4.479">time on the process or even on the</text><text start="222.76" dur="4.679">answer itself look at this amazing</text><text start="225.159" dur="5.16">Theory or result or theorem let me show</text><text start="227.439" dur="5.121">it to you that is not going to work the</text><text start="230.319" dur="4.881">the first thing the student has to have</text><text start="232.56" dur="3.84">is love which is a bit of a strange</text><text start="235.2" dur="3">thing to say right that you don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="236.4" dur="5.119">normally think that math class is about</text><text start="238.2" dur="6.16">love or or any other class but in fact</text><text start="241.519" dur="4.401">that&amp;#39;s the teacher&amp;#39;s first job is help</text><text start="244.36" dur="4.28">the student fall in love with the</text><text start="245.92" dur="4.519">question or the topic or whatever it is</text><text start="248.64" dur="4.56">because once they love</text><text start="250.439" dur="5.321">it most of your work is done there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="253.2" dur="4.08">this perception that math is this big</text><text start="255.76" dur="3.24">scary difficult thing and that there&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="257.28" dur="4.079">lot of fear about it in society and I</text><text start="259" dur="4.08">think that um you know a lot of places</text><text start="261.359" dur="3.761">I&amp;#39;ve worked um as a journalist um</text><text start="263.08" dur="3.96">editors would sort of assume that</text><text start="265.12" dur="3.6">readers would be afraid of math and so</text><text start="267.04" dur="5.52">they would you know try to uh write</text><text start="268.72" dur="5.64">stories in a particular way way um but</text><text start="272.56" dur="4.68">what you said about love I think gets at</text><text start="274.36" dur="5.08">the heart of how to sort of overcome</text><text start="277.24" dur="5.04">that fear right if you can um make</text><text start="279.44" dur="5.28">people care and be interested in it not</text><text start="282.28" dur="4.88">necessarily giving them something big</text><text start="284.72" dur="4.84">and scary and difficult at first U maybe</text><text start="287.16" dur="4.759">you you have a better chance um what are</text><text start="289.56" dur="4.479">some of the tactics to help someone fall</text><text start="291.919" dur="5.201">in love with a</text><text start="294.039" dur="4.401">question humor is one sure if you can</text><text start="297.12" dur="3.4">get the person laughing if there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="298.44" dur="5.24">something delightful because it&amp;#39;s funny</text><text start="300.52" dur="5.48">or surprising or</text><text start="303.68" dur="5.56">tantalizing that&amp;#39;s why puzzles work so</text><text start="306" dur="5.039">well right if if you give a little kid a</text><text start="309.24" dur="4.2">puzzle that is at the right level for</text><text start="311.039" dur="4.16">them you don&amp;#39;t really have to teach them</text><text start="313.44" dur="3.84">or tell them anything they&amp;#39;re I mean</text><text start="315.199" dur="3.881">think about this I I know I&amp;#39;ve given</text><text start="317.28" dur="4.44">plenty of lectures where in the course</text><text start="319.08" dur="4.16">of the lecture I&amp;#39;ll ask people to start</text><text start="321.72" dur="3.24">thinking about a problem if the problem</text><text start="323.24" dur="3.56">is good they will stop listening to the</text><text start="324.96" dur="5.239">lecture they want to start thinking</text><text start="326.8" dur="4.959">about the problem and um</text><text start="330.199" dur="5.801">that&amp;#39;s because problems of the right</text><text start="331.759" dur="6.401">type are inherently engaging and so</text><text start="336" dur="5.08">surprise humor those are those are good</text><text start="338.16" dur="5.36">tactics um people are interested in</text><text start="341.08" dur="4.16">people if you have a story about a</text><text start="343.52" dur="3.48">person that can work I mean there are</text><text start="345.24" dur="4.28">many devices and all of your great</text><text start="347" dur="5.479">science writers at at Quant know these</text><text start="349.52" dur="5.2">things they&amp;#39;re all parts of the hook so</text><text start="352.479" dur="5.121">that&amp;#39;s why a good writer starts with a</text><text start="354.72" dur="5.4">hook right and so I think as a teacher</text><text start="357.6" dur="6.2">um it&amp;#39;s the same thing also I like that</text><text start="360.12" dur="6.16">you phrase uh what I do as being a</text><text start="363.8" dur="5.08">teacher because I think of myself if in</text><text start="366.28" dur="5.12">one word as a teacher a lot of my</text><text start="368.88" dur="5.319">colleagues are driven by a desire to</text><text start="371.4" dur="5.68">solve Mysteries and that&amp;#39;s a little bit</text><text start="374.199" dur="5.72">of a different desire I mean yes you can</text><text start="377.08" dur="4.959">teach yourself something by solving but</text><text start="379.919" dur="3.4">um I&amp;#39;m very happy to explain someone</text><text start="382.039" dur="4.28">else&amp;#39;s</text><text start="383.319" dur="4.44">solution in other words I I think maybe</text><text start="386.319" dur="3.88">let me say it this way I think in math</text><text start="387.759" dur="4.56">and in science generally we have in the</text><text start="390.199" dur="5.041">language of Economics a distribution</text><text start="392.319" dur="5.121">problem not a production problem I think</text><text start="395.24" dur="6.799">we&amp;#39;re producing a lot of great math and</text><text start="397.44" dur="7.96">science that is not Landing in its on</text><text start="402.039" dur="6.28">the Target because we spend so much</text><text start="405.4" dur="5.28">effort on the creation and the discovery</text><text start="408.319" dur="4.761">and we&amp;#39;re not so necessarily trained or</text><text start="410.68" dur="4.32">some of us interested in dissemination I</text><text start="413.08" dur="3.559">think of my own grad students who say</text><text start="415" dur="3.36">I&amp;#39;ve solved the problem I can&amp;#39;t stand</text><text start="416.639" dur="3.601">writing it up I just want to do the next</text><text start="418.36" dur="3.6">problem and I understand that for people</text><text start="420.24" dur="4.76">who love to solve puzzles that is the</text><text start="421.96" dur="5.12">really fun part but the writing and the</text><text start="425" dur="4.36">explaining is part of the social</text><text start="427.08" dur="4">Enterprise of Science and and I think</text><text start="429.36" dur="5.36">the work isn&amp;#39;t done until you do that</text><text start="431.08" dur="6.48">part so um I love that you uh went</text><text start="434.72" dur="4.199">through some of the things that go into</text><text start="437.56" dur="5.319">empathizing and being able to</text><text start="438.919" dur="7.641">communicate um in a way that um helps</text><text start="442.879" dur="6.961">people enjoy math and and and learning</text><text start="446.56" dur="4.8">and I I want to give this a spin I want</text><text start="449.84" dur="5.359">to uh do this I&amp;#39;m sorry to put you on</text><text start="451.36" dur="8.6">the spot but I I want to give you a a a</text><text start="455.199" dur="6.801">something to try out on the crowd and so</text><text start="459.96" dur="3.84">I&amp;#39;d like to ask you did I just move this</text><text start="462" dur="7.08">um I&amp;#39;d like to ask you</text><text start="463.8" dur="7.839">to um break down one of the most famous</text><text start="469.08" dur="3.959">equations and what is widely considered</text><text start="471.639" dur="4.201">the most beautiful equation in</text><text start="473.039" dur="3.641">mathematics or there&amp;#39;s identity uhhuh</text><text start="475.84" dur="3.359">you know</text><text start="476.68" dur="6">for let&amp;#39;s imagine an audience of of</text><text start="479.199" dur="6.361">people who maybe remember some of high</text><text start="482.68" dur="7.32">school math right and so this is um of</text><text start="485.56" dur="6.359">course EI pi plus one equals zero if you</text><text start="490" dur="3.759">could just use some of those skills and</text><text start="491.919" dur="4.801">techniques to may I be while I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="493.759" dur="5.081">stalling to think of how to do it may I</text><text start="496.72" dur="5.199">may I ask some questions of course of</text><text start="498.84" dur="6.639">course for instance does my listener</text><text start="501.919" dur="6.12">know e should I spend time explaining e</text><text start="505.479" dur="4.801">or do they know E I think that I think</text><text start="508.039" dur="4.12">that um it would be fair to to assume</text><text start="510.28" dur="4.319">that that a lot of people wouldn&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="512.159" dur="4.841">a lot about e okay yes so there is a</text><text start="514.599" dur="5.161">certain equation that is often</text><text start="517" dur="6.24">considered the most beautiful equation</text><text start="519.76" dur="7.12">in all of math uh that as Thomas said is</text><text start="523.24" dur="6.68">the letter e which I&amp;#39;ll tell you what</text><text start="526.88" dur="6.36">each letter means e to the I Pi power +</text><text start="529.92" dur="6.8">1 equals z so let&amp;#39;s first talk about</text><text start="533.24" dur="5.48">each of the letters so e e for</text><text start="536.72" dur="3.92">exponential having to do with things</text><text start="538.72" dur="3.799">that grow EXP exponentially or Decay</text><text start="540.64" dur="3.36">exponentially so we&amp;#39;re seeing that</text><text start="542.519" dur="4.121">unfortunately right now with the</text><text start="544" dur="4.48">pandemic we&amp;#39;ve gotten a a very brutal</text><text start="546.64" dur="4.08">dose of what exponential growth means</text><text start="548.48" dur="5.039">when something Builds on itself and</text><text start="550.72" dur="4.48">multiplies by a constant Factor week</text><text start="553.519" dur="4.88">after week or day after day so</text><text start="555.2" dur="5.56">exponential growth um we see all over</text><text start="558.399" dur="4.041">the place in the universe in our own</text><text start="560.76" dur="3.519">bodies in the case of viruses</text><text start="562.44" dur="4.24">proliferating unfortunately we also have</text><text start="564.279" dur="4.481">exponential decay when things Decay by a</text><text start="566.68" dur="6.88">constant Factor day after day so there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="568.76" dur="7.36">so e is kind of more broadly a mascot of</text><text start="573.56" dur="4.399">calculus e is about this kind of</text><text start="576.12" dur="4.2">continuous change where the thing that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="577.959" dur="5.041">changing keeps changing at a changing</text><text start="580.32" dur="4.519">rate so it grows but grows faster and</text><text start="583" dur="5.399">the higher it gets the faster it grows</text><text start="584.839" dur="5.481">or okay so e is to me a kind of</text><text start="588.399" dur="5.12">personification of a whole branch of</text><text start="590.32" dur="8.16">math having to do with growth and Decay</text><text start="593.519" dur="6.641">next I so e to the i i for Imaginary the</text><text start="598.48" dur="3.359">imaginary number</text><text start="600.16" dur="4.56">that enlarged our concept of what</text><text start="601.839" dur="4.361">numbers could be this this was we think</text><text start="604.72" dur="3.2">of numbers as little children as</text><text start="606.2" dur="3.68">magnitudes things that you can mark off</text><text start="607.92" dur="4.56">on a number line or that have to do with</text><text start="609.88" dur="5">counting cookies or whatever but numbers</text><text start="612.48" dur="4.08">in more advanced parts of algebra are</text><text start="614.88" dur="3.12">things that are kind of number alike</text><text start="616.56" dur="3.839">they obey some of the rules that we</text><text start="618" dur="5.48">learned about ordinary numbers but</text><text start="620.399" dur="4.841">they&amp;#39;re more powerful than that and they</text><text start="623.48" dur="3.76">were so mysterious when they were first</text><text start="625.24" dur="4.08">discovered they were called imaginary</text><text start="627.24" dur="4.68">because they didn&amp;#39;t act like the usual</text><text start="629.32" dur="4.519">quantities that we thought about but but</text><text start="631.92" dur="4.08">I turns out to be crucial in algebra and</text><text start="633.839" dur="5.481">So speaking with this language of</text><text start="636" dur="7.2">personification I is part is sort of our</text><text start="639.32" dur="5.639">mascot of algebra Pi everyone knows</text><text start="643.2" dur="4.879">because it&amp;#39;s the most famous Greek</text><text start="644.959" dur="5.961">letter that&amp;#39;s a number um that stands in</text><text start="648.079" dur="5.401">for geometry but not just geometry of</text><text start="650.92" dur="3.96">circles remember Pi is the ratio of the</text><text start="653.48" dur="3.72">circumference of a circle to the</text><text start="654.88" dur="4.6">diameter but so Pi is something about</text><text start="657.2" dur="4.56">converting straight things like diameter</text><text start="659.48" dur="3.919">into round things like circles and</text><text start="661.76" dur="3.6">there&amp;#39;s a very profound mystery about</text><text start="663.399" dur="3.68">converting the straight to the round</text><text start="665.36" dur="3.68">which is that Infinity somehow comes</text><text start="667.079" dur="5.521">into it you you all know that if you</text><text start="669.04" dur="5.84">write down the digits of pi you get</text><text start="672.6" dur="4.479">3.14159 this is goes on forever they</text><text start="674.88" dur="4.079">never repeat they don&amp;#39;t show any pattern</text><text start="677.079" dur="4.361">so somehow in making this conversion</text><text start="678.959" dur="4.601">from the straight to the round Infinity</text><text start="681.44" dur="4.24">comes into play and infinity is left out</text><text start="683.56" dur="6.04">of the equation but it&amp;#39;s sort of lurking</text><text start="685.68" dur="7">there in pi and um everybody body&amp;#39;s</text><text start="689.6" dur="4.96">interested in Infinity so now we&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="692.68" dur="4.32">calculus growth and Decay we&amp;#39;ve got</text><text start="694.56" dur="4.839">algebra we&amp;#39;ve got geometry but then we</text><text start="697" dur="5.68">have the most basic parts of

start="704.04" dur="3.4">they&amp;#39;re like the beginnings of math</text><text start="705.56" dur="4.88">right one the beginning of counting zero</text><text start="707.44" dur="6.199">the void so it&amp;#39;s all packed into this</text><text start="710.44" dur="5.199">one equation and on top of all of that</text><text start="713.639" dur="3.44">it&amp;#39;s unbelievably surprising what does</text><text start="715.639" dur="5.241">it mean to raise a number to an</text><text start="717.079" dur="6.681">imaginary power and and somehow the</text><text start="720.88" dur="4.519">formula

here we connect algebra geometry</text><text start="738.24" dur="4">calculus</text><text start="740.279" dur="4.321">arithmetic I mean that&amp;#39;s a pretty</text><text start="742.24"

dur="2.879">performance yeah sorry for putting on</text><text start="751.16" dur="3.76">the spot there and for the record this</text><text start="752.639" dur="4.241">was not rehearsed at all very much just</text><text start="754.92" dur="4.599">threw that uh out there for for Steve</text><text start="756.88" dur="4.28">because I knew he would um nail it and</text><text start="759.519" dur="6.12">you did thank you so much thank you so</text><text start="761.16" dur="6.96">much um so I want to now kind of walk</text><text start="765.639" dur="3.44">back a little bit in in time and uh I</text><text start="768.12" dur="2.32">know that you know a little bit about</text><text start="769.079" dur="3.401">your childhood but we haven&amp;#39;t talked a</text><text start="770.44" dur="3.959">lot about it I know that you know you</text><text start="772.48" dur="3.52">played tennis and basketball and you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="774.399" dur="3.24">really into chess

start="779.839" dur="7.401">um didn&amp;#39;t like bugs yeah um but but uh</text><text start="785.12" dur="3.92">so you know just want can you tell us</text><text start="787.24" dur="4.12">you know how when did math enter the</text><text start="789.04" dur="3.919">equation when did you know that both</text><text start="791.36" dur="3.88">that you were you know really good at it</text><text start="792.959" dur="4.921">and that you wanted to pursue it</text><text start="795.24" dur="4.839">interesting you assume I&amp;#39;m good at it</text><text start="797.88" dur="4.72">all my lowest grades in college were in</text><text start="800.079" dur="5.401">math really yeah I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="802.6" dur="4.359">especially good at it I I not saying</text><text start="805.48" dur="5.039">that for false modesty I&amp;#39;m not an</text><text start="806.959" dur="6.68">inherently modest person I</text><text start="810.519" dur="4.921">I I&amp;#39;m really good at certain things but</text><text start="813.639" dur="6.121">math is probably one of my weakest</text><text start="815.44" dur="6.6">subjects um in terms of pure brain power</text><text start="819.76" dur="4.16">like to follow a complicated argument</text><text start="822.04" dur="3.72">all my colleagues are better if I if you</text><text start="823.92" dur="5.2">ranked me in the math department I would</text><text start="825.76" dur="6.28">probably be last I&amp;#39;m sure of it I I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="829.12" dur="5.2">slow uh anything that requires doing a</text><text start="832.04" dur="3.599">fast calculation I&amp;#39;m not good at but I</text><text start="834.32" dur="3.16">should come back to the question your</text><text start="835.639" dur="4.081">question was when did I discover I was</text><text start="837.48" dur="4.88">good at math or that I loved math</text><text start="839.72" dur="5.32">and it was a very discreet moment I was</text><text start="842.36" dur="4.839">in a class well actually I was in a</text><text start="845.04" dur="4.799">geometry class and I was doing</text><text start="847.199" dur="4.681">badly uh so I had taken the first</text><text start="849.839" dur="4.641">freshman you know in high school algebra</text><text start="851.88" dur="4.28">2 course I I was a little ahead I had</text><text start="854.48" dur="3.88">done some algebra already in middle</text><text start="856.16" dur="4.2">school so I was in this algebra 2 course</text><text start="858.36" dur="3.839">it was fine they put me in a geometry</text><text start="860.36" dur="3.32">class taught by the football coach which</text><text start="862.199" dur="3.481">is a strange thing a lot of times the</text><text start="863.68" dur="4">coach is thought to be someone suitable</text><text start="865.68" dur="4.32">to teach math I don&amp;#39;t know why that like</text><text start="867.68" dur="4.32">it&amp;#39;s a very manly subject or some</text><text start="870" dur="4.12">ridiculous thing and health too right</text><text start="872" dur="4">Health too okay so anyway Mr White the</text><text start="874.12" dur="4.48">football coach was teaching geometry and</text><text start="876" dur="4.44">I was really bored in the class and not</text><text start="878.6" dur="3.679">doing well that&amp;#39;s always been true my</text><text start="880.44" dur="4.199">whole academic career when I&amp;#39;m bored I</text><text start="882.279" dur="4.36">don&amp;#39;t pay attention and don&amp;#39;t do well so</text><text start="884.639" dur="4.12">I was bored and getting maybe a c or</text><text start="886.639" dur="4.32">something and then something great</text><text start="888.759" dur="4.88">happened which was that the school said</text><text start="890.959" dur="4.401">you shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this badly rather</text><text start="893.639" dur="3.921">than punishing me or putting me in some</text><text start="895.36" dur="4.479">remedial geometry they said we think you</text><text start="897.56" dur="3.279">should skip geometry and do pre-calculus</text><text start="899.839" dur="4.12">starting</text><text start="900.839" dur="5.081">tomorrow and that was great because then</text><text start="903.959" dur="4.481">suddenly I had something interesting to</text><text start="905.92" dur="5.8">learn about and my teacher Mr Johnson</text><text start="908.44" dur="6.04">had a beard he had gone to MIT he he</text><text start="911.72" dur="4.88">wasn&amp;#39;t the football coach he he seemed</text><text start="914.48" dur="3.96">like Oh I thought okay I could learn</text><text start="916.6" dur="4.799">from Mr Johnson and he was very</text><text start="918.44" dur="4.8">difficult um but fair but he asked us a</text><text start="921.399" dur="5.321">lot of hard questions and so in the</text><text start="923.24" dur="4.719">course of one of his uh discussions one</text><text start="926.72" dur="3.28">day he mentioned that there was a</text><text start="927.959" dur="3.56">certain geometry problem of all things</text><text start="930" dur="3.399">he wasn&amp;#39;t teaching geometry teaching</text><text start="931.519" dur="4.32">pre-calculus he said here&amp;#39;s this hard</text><text start="933.399" dur="4.201">geometry problem and I&amp;#39;ve been</text><text start="935.839" dur="4.081">suggesting it to students for years and</text><text start="937.6" dur="4.28">I&amp;#39;ve never seen anyone do it just</text><text start="939.92" dur="3.88">mentioned that and I thought that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="941.88" dur="3.8">interesting what&amp;#39;s you know I&amp;#39;ll tell</text><text start="943.8" dur="4.24">you the problem if you&amp;#39;re curious it was</text><text start="945.68" dur="3.519">if two angle bis sectors of a triangle</text><text start="948.04" dur="3.359">are</text><text start="949.199" dur="5.361">congruent okay so remember an angle bis</text><text start="951.399" dur="5.161">sector cuts the angle in half equally</text><text start="954.56" dur="4.519">right so if two angle bis sectors have</text><text start="956.56" dur="4.279">the same length the triangle is isos</text><text start="959.079" dur="3.76">least sort of seems like it would be</text><text start="960.839" dur="4.161">true and in fact the other direction is</text><text start="962.839" dur="4.12">easy if the triangle is isoceles showing</text><text start="965" dur="4.319">that the angle bis sectors are congruent</text><text start="966.959" dur="4.8">is pretty easy but to do it this</text><text start="969.319" dur="3.96">direction if congruent angle bis sectors</text><text start="971.759" dur="4.041">then the triangle is</text><text start="973.279" dur="4.081">isoceles Mr Johnson said that&amp;#39;s a hard</text><text start="975.8" dur="3.24">problem so I thought that&amp;#39;s very</text><text start="977.36" dur="4">interesting then he said actually I</text><text start="979.04" dur="4.4">don&amp;#39;t know how to do it and I thought</text><text start="981.36" dur="5.279">you&amp;#39;re kidding Mr Johnson doesn&amp;#39;t with</text><text start="983.44" dur="5.759">the beard can&amp;#39;t do the angle bis sector</text><text start="986.639" dur="4.241">problem how could that be so so I</text><text start="989.199" dur="3.521">thought okay I you know until that time</text><text start="990.88" dur="4.12">in my life I could do any geometry</text><text start="992.72" dur="4.28">problem the school asked me to do so I</text><text start="995" dur="4.72">started working on it and I couldn&amp;#39;t do</text><text start="997" dur="3.959">it and you know I spent a day or two on</text><text start="999.72" dur="3.16">it I still couldn&amp;#39;t do it I thought</text><text start="1000.959" dur="3.601">about it all day long then it was weeks</text><text start="1002.88" dur="3.6">I still couldn&amp;#39;t do it then it was</text><text start="1004.56" dur="3.719">months and the whole time I was in</text><text start="1006.48" dur="4.44">French class and they would say you know</text><text start="1008.279" dur="4.68">conjugate these verbs and they used to</text><text start="1010.92" dur="3.359">have like this kid had to conjugate this</text><text start="1012.959" dur="2.88">verb and then it would go to the next</text><text start="1014.279" dur="3.12">kid and it would go around the room like</text><text start="1015.839" dur="3.401">a train and I could feel it was coming</text><text start="1017.399" dur="4.401">toward me but I was thinking about the</text><text start="1019.24" dur="4.719">angle bis sectors so it was really</text><text start="1021.8" dur="5.639">messing me up both in basketball and in</text><text start="1023.959" dur="4.6">French class and um I got obsessed with</text><text start="1027.439" dur="3.12">this</text><text start="1028.559" dur="4.601">question okay so you&amp;#39;re wondering what</text><text start="1030.559" dur="5.441">happened well at some point I thought I</text><text start="1033.16" dur="6.24">had solved it and it was a prep school</text><text start="1036" dur="5.4">and Mr Johnson lived close by uh to the</text><text start="1039.4" dur="4.08">campus and so I asked could I I think I</text><text start="1041.4" dur="4.399">got it can I come over to your house and</text><text start="1043.48" dur="3.959">show it to you it was a Sunday morning</text><text start="1045.799" dur="3.441">and he was there and his pajamas his</text><text start="1047.439" dur="4.041">little kids were there and he sat at his</text><text start="1049.24" dur="4.799">kitchen table I showed him each step he</text><text start="1051.48" dur="4.72">carefully sternly checked each step he</text><text start="1054.039" dur="3.801">said it&amp;#39;s correct proof and then he</text><text start="1056.2" dur="4.16">wrote a little note to the Headmaster of</text><text start="1057.84" dur="4.52">the school Steven has real talent gets</text><text start="1060.36" dur="6.04">me choked up thinking about</text><text start="1062.36" dur="5.88">it so just moving from that point when</text><text start="1066.4" dur="6.8">you you you found you started to love</text><text start="1068.24" dur="7.439">math and you at some point uh you did</text><text start="1073.2" dur="4.64">grad school became a mathematician U</text><text

start="1096.6" dur="5.4">behaviors and then you wrote your first</text><text start="1098.48" dur="5.199">popular book in 2003 a book called sync</text><text start="1102" dur="4.24">related to your</text><text start="1103.679" dur="5.601">work first of all what was the</text><text start="1106.24" dur="5.319">inspiration for that and what were the</text><text start="1109.28" dur="4.56">challenges of going from teaching in a</text><text start="1111.559" dur="4.081">classroom to writing a book you know my</text><text start="1113.84" dur="4.319">whole life I always thought I wanted to</text><text start="1115.64" dur="4.68">be a teacher or if not a teacher a</text><text start="1118.159" dur="3.64">science writer so we skipped over that I</text><text start="1120.32" dur="3.76">always thought I would like to be a</text><text start="1121.799" dur="5.24">science writer and I applied for summer</text><text start="1124.08" dur="5.079">internships and kept getting rejected</text><text start="1127.039" dur="4.201">and including famously to me I mean I</text><text start="1129.159" dur="4.241">saved the letter from the New York Times</text><text start="1131.24"
