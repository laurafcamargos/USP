start="314.24" dur="3.96">problem at the time I was just kind of</text><text start="315.68" dur="4.26">pushing the bits around even so I was</text><text start="318.2" dur="7.29">able to get something

dur="5.16">extra dollar to match the color to the</text><text start="348.71" dur="5.13">actual cartoon so the the tread right on</text><text start="352.19" dur="3.48">top of the wheels that right on top of</text><text start="353.84" dur="3.66">the shoulder screws and the treads were</text><text start="355.67" dur="4.32">a lot of fun because they&amp;#39;re actually 3d</text><text start="357.5" dur="4.41">printed I designed the tread to be a</text><text start="359.99" dur="3.84">little too small for the wheelbase so</text><text start="361.91" dur="4.259">we&amp;#39;d have to stretch to reach around the</text><text start="363.83" dur="5.13">wheels and then I printed it out of</text><text start="366.169" dur="4.411">flexible ninjaflex filament this stuff</text><text start="368.96" dur="3.48">is pretty creative if you print it out</text><text start="370.58" dur="3.57">of a 3d printer and it&amp;#39;s like super</text><text start="372.44" dur="7.11">flexible once it comes off the print bed</text><text start="374.15" dur="7.56">basically a rubber I made an attempt to</text><text start="379.55" dur="4.26">dye the treads with fabric dye but that</text><text start="381.71" dur="3.99">only turns on blue so I ended up</text><text start="383.81" dur="3.93">actually leaving the treads soaking in</text><text start="385.7" dur="4.23">pure India ink overnight the day before</text><text start="387.74" dur="5.33">Maker Faire and that ended up working</text><text start="389.93" dur="3.14">but it was a bit extreme</text><text start="393.449" dur="4.361">the butter box

start="400.33" dur="3.66">aluminum because it&amp;#39;s easier to bend</text><text start="401.979" dur="3.75">without tearing everything else was the</text><text start="403.99" dur="4.829">common 6061 alloy</text><text start="405.729" dur="5.071">I glued properly scaled pre doubts to</text><text start="408.819" dur="4.5">the sheet of aluminum and then cut out</text><text start="410.8" dur="4.109">all of the pieces on a scroll saw most</text><text start="413.319" dur="3.21">pieces needed a bit of touch-up work</text><text start="414.909" dur="5.491">with a belt sander and some hand files</text><text start="416.529" dur="5.341">and then came the fun part you may</text><text start="420.4" dur="3.06">notice that these flat sheets really</text><text start="421.87" dur="5.039">don&amp;#39;t resemble a butter bad body</text><text start="423.46" dur="7.049">he&amp;#39;s 3d and I cut all of these parts out</text><text start="426.909" dur="5.85">on a flat 2d stock so I had to take all</text><text start="430.509" dur="6.21">of these cut parts to a metal break and</text><text start="432.759" dur="6.21">actually bend them into shape the break</text><text start="436.719" dur="4.081">is like a giant clam fix that the clamp</text><text start="438.969" dur="3.57">has an angle built into it so when you</text><text start="440.8" dur="4.199">put a piece of metal in it and close the</text><text start="442.539" dur="5.22">jaws the metal gets bent this is how the</text><text start="444.999" dur="7.051">entire body and head became 3d boxy</text><text start="447.759" dur="5.91">shapes out of flat 2d stock of course</text><text start="452.05" dur="3.78">some of the pieces geometrically didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="453.669" dur="3.601">fit in the break for the entire bend so</text><text start="455.83" dur="4.759">I finished a few of the bends for the</text><text start="457.27" dur="3.319">flat draw of ice and some pliers</text><text start="471.3" dur="4.48">to assemble all of these small metal</text><text start="474.22" dur="3.449">body parts for the butter bot I</text><text start="475.78" dur="3.81">originally wanted to learn how to TIG</text><text start="477.669" dur="4.261">weld but then I realized that learning</text><text start="479.59" dur="5.699">to weld by learning to TIG weld aluminum</text><text start="481.93" dur="4.859">was probably a bit of a stretch plus it</text><text start="485.289" dur="3.421">would have been really difficult to make</text><text start="486.789" dur="4.44">all the welds in the really tiny little</text><text start="488.71" dur="6.239">joints and the welder went away so</text><text start="491.229" dur="6.511">instead I learned to braze metal and I</text><text start="494.949" dur="5.071">used aluminum brazing rod to make all of</text><text start="497.74" dur="4.079">my metal to metal joints brazing is</text><text start="500.02" dur="3.299">basically just like soldering except the</text><text start="501.819" dur="3.241">melting point is higher and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="503.319" dur="5.91">intended to be structural instead of</text><text start="505.06" dur="6.329">electrically conductive you pre heat all</text><text start="509.229" dur="3.901">of the pieces with a torch and then let</text><text start="511.389" dur="3.51">the hot aluminum melt the brazing rod</text><text start="513.13" dur="3.659">that you apply from a stick so I</text><text start="514.899" dur="3.901">discovered that it&amp;#39;s very difficult to</text><text start="516.789" dur="3.69">close large gaps this way but if all the</text><text start="518.8" dur="3.27">conditions are right and your surfaces</text><text start="520.479" dur="7.321">are well prepared you can get a pretty</text><text start="522.07" dur="7.53">strong joint I use the same technique to</text><text start="527.8" dur="3.75">assemble the butter box arms and face</text><text start="529.6" dur="3.45">except those pieces weren&amp;#39;t hand cut</text><text start="531.55" dur="5.51">from cheap stock they were actually cut</text><text start="533.05" dur="4.01">out on a CNC mill at the hackerspace</text><text start="537.329" dur="4.091">it&amp;#39;s a carving mill and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be</text><text start="539.86" dur="3.57">surprised if it&amp;#39;s the most Binford</text><text start="541.42" dur="3.57">carving in existence because some of the</text><text start="543.43" dur="3.99">awesome people at the hackerspace to</text><text start="544.99" dur="4.83">replace one of the axes and belt with a</text><text start="547.42" dur="3.87">lead screw so it&amp;#39;s pretty rock-solid</text><text start="549.82" dur="3.959">but I think they&amp;#39;re actually going to do</text><text start="551.29" dur="3.9">a full conversion soon and replace the</text><text start="553.779" dur="3.62">other axis and then it&amp;#39;s going to be</text><text start="555.19" dur="4.56">unstoppable</text><text start="557.399" dur="4.421">the awesome thing about computer-aided</text><text start="559.75" dur="3.99">machining is that once you finally get</text><text start="561.82" dur="3.329">good parts and you get all the settings</text><text start="563.74" dur="4.409">right you can make a whole bunch of them</text><text start="565.149" dur="5.341">so I use fusion 360 to program and</text><text start="568.149" dur="3.961">simulate the cut and there&amp;#39;s lots of</text><text start="570.49" dur="3.659">failed cuts when you&amp;#39;re working with a</text><text start="572.11" dur="4.5">new material like aluminum in this case</text><text start="574.149" dur="4.201">and eventually you get the real thing</text><text start="576.61" dur="3.87">and then you just sort of send the</text><text start="578.35" dur="6.81">designs over to the Machine then you can</text><text start="580.48" dur="6.84">start mass producing them after a bit of</text><text start="585.16" dur="4.14">sanding drilling a few extra holes and</text><text start="587.32" dur="4.639">squaring off some edges the parts were</text><text start="589.3" dur="2.659">ready to assemble</text><text start="592.79" dur="4.54">one of my original design criteria was</text><text start="595.59" dur="3.45">to make the butter bottom poseable as a</text><text start="597.33" dur="3.78">stop motion armature since I couldn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="599.04" dur="4.08">fit motors inside it I figured I wanted</text><text start="601.11" dur="4.5">to make it move somehow so I designed</text><text start="603.12" dur="4.8">all of the arm joints to be these three</text><text start="605.61" dur="4.44">layer joints with one tapped hole one</text><text start="607.92" dur="4.74">slip fit hole and one countersunk hole</text><text start="610.05" dur="4.77">with this design only the middle layer</text><text start="612.66" dur="3.75">rotates and no matter how you move it</text><text start="614.82" dur="3.48">it&amp;#39;ll never loosen the screw that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="616.41" dur="3.6">holding it together because all of the</text><text start="618.3" dur="4.23">friction is just between plates of metal</text><text start="620.01" dur="3.93">all the screw does is pull plate number</text><text start="622.53" dur="3.51">one and plate number three closer</text><text start="623.94" dur="4.11">together so that it pinches plate number</text><text start="626.04" dur="5.25">two and basically slows it down when you</text><text start="628.05" dur="5.19">try to move it of course in order to</text><text start="631.29" dur="3.87">rotate the shoulders and neck you can&amp;#39;t</text><text start="633.24" dur="4.05">have a plate on both sides so I had to</text><text start="635.16" dur="4.68">improvise I used a combination of my</text><text start="637.29" dur="4.26">lock nuts washers and thrust bearings to</text><text start="639.84"

was</text><text start="656.64" dur="3.9">cut from a solid chunk of aluminum so</text><text start="658.77" dur="4.319">butt plates one and three are basically</text><text start="660.54" dur="4.77">the same thing creating it&amp;#39;s not as a</text><text start="663.089" dur="4.141">job extremely well suited to a manual</text><text start="665.31" dur="4.17">mill with an eighth inch square cutter</text><text start="667.23" dur="2.85">but we don&amp;#39;t have a mill to hackerspace</text><text start="669.48" dur="2.88">right now</text><text start="670.08" dur="4.83">so I butchered one of these parts trying</text><text start="672.36" dur="4.11">to use a drill press as a mill and that</text><text start="674.91" dur="3.51">didn&amp;#39;t work and then I burned out a</text><text start="676.47" dur="4.65">dremel trying to cut the notch that way</text><text start="678.42" dur="4.77">and that didn&amp;#39;t work and then I ended up</text><text start="681.12" dur="4.38">starting with a very dull hacksaw and</text><text start="683.19" dur="3.99">ended up just accepting the fact that I</text><text start="685.5" dur="3.63">was going to have to sweat and I filed</text><text start="687.18" dur="2.43">this thing all the way down it was not</text><text start="689.13" dur="3.78">fun</text><text start="689.61" dur="5.07">but it ended up working I also use the</text><text start="692.91" dur="3.33">file to countersink the back of the</text><text start="694.68" dur="3.99">shoulder for the bolt head and make it</text><text start="696.24" dur="5.58">look all nice and clean</text><text start="698.67" dur="5.13">the butter pots I was a fish I adore</text><text start="701.82" dur="4.23">people it was the cheapest thing I could</text><text start="703.8" dur="4.5">think of to get a nice big lens and</text><text start="706.05" dur="4.229">because cutting round stock is so much</text><text start="708.3" dur="3.99">more fun when it&amp;#39;s fitting I cut off the</text><text start="710.279" dur="5.041">end of the peep hole on the lathe before</text><text start="712.29" dur="5.489">turning the actual eye socket the socket</text><text start="715.32" dur="4.44">started out as a big section of the</text><text start="717.779" dur="3.87">super thick walled aluminum round stock</text><text start="719.76" dur="3.389">that ended up giving two different</text><text start="721.649" dur="3.241">internal diameters in two different</text><text start="723.149" dur="3.721">external diameters in order to fit the</text><text start="724.89" dur="6.09">peep hole on the inside and match the</text><text start="726.87" dur="6.089">design that I wanted on the outside the</text><text start="730.98" dur="4.349">eye socket got a small threaded plate</text><text start="732.959" dur="4.471">raised into it and a coat of black paint</text><text start="735.329" dur="3.901">and then the head could be assembled so</text><text start="737.43" dur="3.719">the butter BOTS entire head is actually</text><text start="739.23" dur="4.049">held together with a single screw which</text><text start="741.149" dur="3.841">extends from the back of the head into</text><text start="743.279" dur="3.75">the threaded plate at the back of the</text><text start="744.99" dur="4.11">eye and somewhere in the middle there</text><text start="747.029" dur="4.771">hold the face sandwich in between them</text><text start="749.1" dur="4.89">the peephole was just glued into the eye</text><text start="751.8" dur="6.06">socket with some Santa acrylate super</text><text start="753.99" dur="5.82">glue at this point all the metal parts</text><text start="757.86" dur="3.539">were complete so I sat down the Friday</text><text start="759.81" dur="3.269">night before I was planning on leaving</text><text start="761.399" dur="3.841">for Maker Faire and I spent a few hours</text><text start="763.079" dur="4.111">giving everything a nice 400 grit</text><text start="765.24" dur="3.63">surface finish I was planning on</text><text start="767.19" dur="3.87">weathering the entire build to make it</text><text start="768.87" dur="3.839">look sort of old and worn but as it</text><text start="771.06" dur="3.6">turns out when you actually build</text><text start="772.709" dur="4.051">something from metal all you have to do</text><text start="774.66" dur="4.95">to make it look worn is to clean it less</text><text start="776.76" dur="4.47">there&amp;#39;s no fake surfaces or materials</text><text start="779.61" dur="3.77">that need attention in order to look</text><text start="781.23" dur="2.15">good</text><text start="783.779" dur="4.771">as a finishing touch I added some 3d</text><text start="786.48" dur="4.2">printed plastic nubs and glued a couple</text><text start="788.55" dur="3.93">pieces of wire and an LED on top of the</text><text start="790.68" dur="9.209">butter BOTS head and then he was</text><text start="792.48" dur="10.229">basically done since completion he&amp;#39;s had</text><text start="799.889" dur="5.19">a a pretty exciting life you got to help</text><text start="802.709" dur="4.68">out with some homework he provided some</text><text start="805.079" dur="3.961">witty comebacks over chat and even got</text><text start="807.389" dur="6.151">to go to the grocery store and get some</text><text start="809.04" dur="6.57">butter it&amp;#39;s been a very fun project and</text><text start="813.54" dur="3.63">I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot I&amp;#39;m also sure that</text><text start="815.61" dur="4.019">you&amp;#39;ll see a lot of use aluminum working</text><text start="817.17" dur="4.109">techniques show up in many videos to</text><text start="819.629" dur="3.361">come because I&amp;#39;ve sort of added them to</text><text start="821.279" dur="3.87">my mental toolbox now and I start</text><text start="822.99" dur="3.99">planning for a project I want to take a</text><text start="825.149" dur="3.901">very brief soapbox and say this is</text><text start="826.98" dur="5.099">probably the most instructional projects</text><text start="829.05" dur="4.259">that I&amp;#39;ve ever undertaken so over the 4</text><text start="832.079" dur="3.18">months that I was working on this</text><text start="833.309" dur="4.5">project I learned how to use all of</text><text start="835.259" dur="4.32">these new tools and techniques that I</text><text start="837.809" dur="3.78">would not have learned had I not</text><text start="839.579" dur="3.75">attempted to build a butter bot and in</text><text start="841.589" dur="3.331">fact these skills have already benefited</text><text start="843.329" dur="3.661">me at work because I&amp;#39;ve been making some</text><text start="844.92" dur="3.899">equipment for an SEM and have used some</text><text start="846.99" dur="5.099">of the same fabrication techniques at</text><text start="848.819" dur="5.401">work so always sit down to projects that</text><text start="852.089" dur="4.021">you don&amp;#39;t have the skills to finish</text><text start="854.22" dur="3.539">because if you want the final product it</text><text start="856.11" dur="4.529">forces you to learn new things</text><text start="857.759" dur="5.221">if people want plans to build this exact</text><text start="860.639" dur="4.56">iteration of the butter bot then I&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="862.98" dur="4.25">try to condense all of my sketches and</text><text start="865.199" dur="4.2">CAD files and stuff into something</text><text start="867.23" dur="4.06">relatively comprehensible they can go</text><text start="869.399" dur="3.18">online so let me know if you&amp;#39;re</text><text start="871.29" dur="3.57">interested in the plans and I&amp;#39;ll try to</text><text start="872.579" dur="3.901">make that available I aside from that</text><text start="874.86" dur="3.12">thanks for watching I
