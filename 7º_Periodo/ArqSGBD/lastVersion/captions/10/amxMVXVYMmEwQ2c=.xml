dur="3.87">time I talked about changing your mind</text><text start="9.059" dur="4.981">this is always hard to discuss because</text><text start="11.519" dur="4.53">the specifics are often quite personal</text><text start="14.04" dur="4.079">but the biggest non personal thing I&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="16.049" dur="3.81">changed my opinion on is breakfast I</text><text start="18.119" dur="3.601">used to believe breakfast was absolutely</text><text start="19.859" dur="4.141">vital not just believe it I had evidence</text><text start="21.72" dur="4.799">that skipping nay even delaying</text><text start="24" dur="3.9">breakfast ruined everything</text><text start="26.519" dur="3.481">but as I&amp;#39;ve tried to get healthier</text><text start="27.9" dur="3.959">slowly been

dur="4.319">breakfast is booked but after an</text><text start="35.64" dur="4.77">admittedly rough adjustment period my</text><text start="37.739" dur="4.921">body no longer needed breakfast and it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="40.41" dur="4.89">hard to describe just how much of a huge</text><text start="42.66" dur="4.379">quality of life improvement this has</text><text start="45.3"

breakfast</text><text start="51.12" dur="3.329">sometimes particularly on vacations</text><text start="52.92" dur="3.51">because it&amp;#39;s clearly the best of the</text><text start="54.449"

start="168.63" dur="3.63">ways I&amp;#39;m working to make this better is</text><text start="170.22" dur="4.47">simply to have the data about how I</text><text start="172.26" dur="4.38">spend my time

had to enroll at</text><text start="186.84" dur="3">a university tomorrow and had to choose</text><text start="188.22" dur="3.09">one field of study which would you</text><text start="189.84" dur="3.33">choose I&amp;#39;d like to say I take a</text><text start="191.31" dur="3.72">programming course but I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I</text><text start="193.17" dur="3.84">couldn&amp;#39;t pass at the university level</text><text start="195.03" dur="3.96">constants and functions and loops oh my</text><text start="197.01" dur="4.62">are fun and clear but once it gets to</text><text start="198.99" dur="4.68">pointers it&amp;#39;s a level too far so if I</text><text start="201.63" dur="4.05">needed to pass I&amp;#39;d probably sign up for</text><text start="203.67" dur="3.63">economics I dropped out of that master&amp;#39;s</text><text start="205.68" dur="3.36">course as mentioned in a previous Q&amp;amp;A</text><text start="207.3" dur="3.57">because it wasn&amp;#39;t the right fit in my</text><text start="209.04" dur="3.66">life at that time but I&amp;#39;d be happy to</text><text start="210.87" dur="3.66">give it a go again of all the classes</text><text start="212.7" dur="3.84">you&amp;#39;ve ever taken at uni what was your</text><text start="214.53" dur="4.05">hardest what did you hate the most why</text><text start="216.54" dur="3.84">well the physics classes in my later</text><text start="218.58" dur="3.84">years were the hardest and we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="220.38" dur="4.89">probably the hardest intellectual thing</text><text start="222.42" dur="4.83">I&amp;#39;ve ever done or will do but that&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="225.27" dur="4.2">boring er question more interesting</text><text start="227.25" dur="4.2">question is which class I hated the most</text><text start="229.47" dur="3.9">that was a required humanities reading</text><text start="231.45" dur="3.84">class it was one of those classes where</text><text start="233.37" dur="4.02">the professor had free rein to just</text><text start="235.29" dur="3.87">select a bunch of books they liked and</text><text start="237.39" dur="4.04">for students to read them and write</text><text start="239.16" dur="4.41">essays agreeing with the professor or</text><text start="241.43" dur="4.6">disagreeing in a way the professor</text><text start="243.57" dur="3.99">agreed with God did I hate it I really</text><text start="246.03" dur="3.51">think it&amp;#39;s the kind of class that</text><text start="247.56" dur="3.72">professors make mandatory because they</text><text start="249.54" dur="4.11">like to teach it and it makes them look</text><text start="251.28" dur="4.41">smart and it&amp;#39;s easy and not because it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="253.65" dur="5.04">remotely good for the students involved</text><text start="255.69" dur="5.07">anyway it&amp;#39;s had to be done and I had a</text><text start="258.69" dur="4.05">pretty good idea in advance I would hate</text><text start="260.76" dur="4.36">it so at my college there was an option</text><text start="262.74" dur="5.2">to compress an entire academic year of</text><text start="265.12" dur="4.769">these classes into one intense summer so</text><text start="267.94" dur="4.229">I stayed at college over what was</text><text start="269.889" dur="4.831">vacation for most people to finish this</text><text start="272.169" dur="4.261">class as fast as possible I&amp;#39;ve always</text><text start="274.72" dur="3.72">been pretty good at reading a lot using</text><text start="276.43" dur="3.9">an on off schedule when I need to and it</text><text start="278.44" dur="4.229">served me well here I think I read</text><text start="280.33" dur="4.83">something like 30 stupid or boring or</text><text start="282.669" dur="4.771">flowery or pompous books over that</text><text start="285.16" dur="4.89">summer anyway it works so well it was a</text><text start="287.44" dur="5.009">strategy I used every summer compressing</text><text start="290.05" dur="4.649">as many dumb mandatory classes into as</text><text start="292.449" dur="4.53">short a time as possible if your school</text><text start="294.699" dur="4.021">gives that as an option I highly</text><text start="296.979" dur="3.66">recommend it so you have more time</text><text start="298.72" dur="3.63">during the rest of the year to focus on</text><text start="300.639" dur="3.991">more important things raisins and</text><text start="302.35" dur="4.11">chocolate chip cookies gross what noise</text><text start="304.63" dur="3.39">do you wake up to none</text><text start="306.46" dur="3.78">I used to use music to wake up to</text><text
