I</text><text start="12.08" dur="5.08">could just because it was beautiful just</text><text start="15.04" dur="5.159">as a rather in the same way a musician</text><text start="17.16" dur="5.44">plays the violin not not expecting to</text><text start="20.199" dur="3.761">change the world but just because he</text><text start="22.6" dur="3.999">loves the</text><text start="23.96" dur="5.159">instrument my name is Freeman Dyson and</text><text start="26.599" dur="4.321">I&amp;#39;m a professor retired at The Institute</text><text start="29.119" dur="5.321">for advanced studies in</text><text start="30.92" dur="6.639">Princeton and when I was a young kid I</text><text start="34.44" dur="6">used to scribble big numbers and draw</text><text start="37.559" dur="5.84">pictures of the Solo System so obviously</text><text start="40.44" dur="7.2">I was interested right from the</text><text start="43.399" dur="7.041">start I think the decisive moment in my</text><text start="47.64" dur="5.52">career path was reading the book men of</text><text start="50.44" dur="4.599">mathematics by Eric Temple Bell he</text><text start="53.16" dur="7.16">showed the mathematicians as being</text><text start="55.039" dur="9.361">mostly Crooks and and and people of very</text><text start="60.32" dur="6.52">kind of qualities not at all Saints many</text><text start="64.4" dur="4.759">of them quite unscrupulous and not very</text><text start="66.84" dur="5.24">clever and still they managed to do</text><text start="69.159" dur="5.481">great mathematics so it it told the kid</text><text start="72.08" dur="5.719">that if they can do it why can&amp;#39;t you and</text><text start="74.64" dur="5.2">and that was certainly what turned me on</text><text start="77.799" dur="6.041">I came from England to the United States</text><text start="79.84" dur="6.639">to study Physics I applied to Cornell</text><text start="83.84" dur="5.279">University to work with Hans beta who is</text><text start="86.479" dur="4.96">a famous physicist but the amazing thing</text><text start="89.119" dur="5.561">was in the very first week I was there I</text><text start="91.439" dur="5.121">met dick feinan who is an absolute</text><text start="94.68" dur="3.88">genius and of course I&amp;#39;d never even</text><text start="96.56" dur="4.72">heard of him he was not so famous in</text><text start="98.56" dur="6.72">those days but I immediately realized</text><text start="101.28" dur="7.36">this was the guy and and he was such a</text><text start="105.28" dur="6.32">tremendous just sparkling character a</text><text start="108.64" dur="5.04">clown and always telling stories and and</text><text start="111.6" dur="5">in addition to that very brilliant and</text><text start="113.68" dur="5.479">and so so I attached myself to fan as</text><text start="116.6" dur="4.28">quickly as I could he was working on</text><text start="119.159" dur="3.801">these problems of quantum</text><text start="120.88" dur="4.599">electrodynamics and he had done a great</text><text start="122.96" dur="3.839">deal which was very beautiful but which</text><text start="125.479" dur="3.601">nobody else</text><text start="126.799" dur="5.241">understood and he loved to talk and I</text><text start="129.08" dur="5.76">loved to listen so within 6 months I</text><text start="132.04" dur="5.6">pretty well mastered his language and</text><text start="134.84" dur="5.2">within one year I actually was able to</text><text start="137.64" dur="4.76">improve on it and I translated his ideas</text><text start="140.04" dur="6.76">into mathematics and so it became more</text><text start="142.4" dur="7.6">accessible to the world and as a result</text><text start="146.8" dur="6.48">I became famous and and</text><text start="150" dur="6">but it all happened within about 6</text><text start="153.28" dur="5.72">months I was very much interested in</text><text start="156" dur="5.879">space travel and and uh so the the next</text><text start="159" dur="4.92">exciting thing I did actually was to</text><text start="161.879" dur="4.28">work with a company in California called</text><text start="163.92" dur="3.84">general atomic which still exists I</text><text start="166.159" dur="4.881">worked for the company for a couple of</text><text start="167.76" dur="5.24">years building a spaceship and so we</text><text start="171.04" dur="4.279">decided we would go around the solar</text><text start="173" dur="5.28">system with a space ship driven by</text><text start="175.319" dur="4.881">nuclear bombs so we would launch the</text><text start="178.28" dur="4.599">ship into space bomb bom bomb bom bom</text><text start="180.2" dur="7.2">bomb bom bomb going up about four bombs</text><text start="182.879" dur="6.881">per second going up and uh all the way</text><text start="187.4" dur="5.24">to Mars and then afterwards to Jupiter</text><text start="189.76" dur="6.6">and Saturn and we intended to go</text><text start="192.64" dur="6.4">ourselves we had actual model spaceships</text><text start="196.36" dur="5.519">about so big about about a meter in</text><text start="199.04" dur="4.759">diameter or so with chemical explosives</text><text start="201.879" dur="4.92">which actually went BM bom bom bomb a</text><text start="203.799" dur="6.321">few times a few hundred ft up so that</text><text start="206.799" dur="5.64">lasted for 2 years by that time it was</text><text start="210.12" dur="4.36">clear that the competition was actually</text><text start="212.439" dur="5.041">going to win the competition being Vera</text><text start="214.48" dur="5.56">F Brown and the Apollo program which was</text><text start="217.48" dur="5.52">going to go with ordinary Rockets to the</text><text start="220.04" dur="4.839">moon I I think the notion that I like to</text><text start="223" dur="3.84">oppose the consensus in science is</text><text start="224.879" dur="4.121">totally wrong there&amp;#39;s only one subject</text><text start="226.84" dur="4.84">that I&amp;#39;ve been controversial which is</text><text start="229" dur="7.12">climate I&amp;#39;m not really a climate expert</text><text start="231.68" dur="6.919">but I have strong opinions and the most</text><text start="236.12" dur="4.08">strong and firmly based of my opinions</text><text start="238.599" dur="4.56">is that this is really still a</text><text start="240.2" dur="5.239">mysterious subject and that climate is</text><text start="243.159" dur="4.72">not at all well understood I&amp;#39;m not</text><text start="245.439" dur="5.401">saying the majority is necessarily wrong</text><text start="247.879" dur="5.92">I&amp;#39;m saying that uh they don&amp;#39;t understand</text><text start="250.84" dur="6.079">what what they&amp;#39;re seeing and and and and</text><text start="253.799" dur="5.72">uh so it will take a lot of very hard</text><text start="256.919" dur="4.801">work before that question is settled</text><text start="259.519" dur="3.881">people are often asking me what&amp;#39;s going</text><text start="261.72" dur="3.6">to happen next in science that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="263.4" dur="3.56">important of course the whole point is</text><text start="265.32" dur="4.12">that if it&amp;#39;s important it&amp;#39;s something we</text><text start="266.96" dur="5.36">didn&amp;#39;t expect in order for science to go</text><text start="269.44" dur="5.08">on it it has to have Mysteries that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="272.32" dur="6.4">that&amp;#39;s the way it has been up till now</text><text start="274.52" dur="4.2">so I hope very much it continues</text><text start="280.95" dur="39.4">[Music]</text></transcript>
