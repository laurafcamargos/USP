<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="14.599" dur="7.301">but for Christmas I got one of the new</text><text start="19.02" dur="5.91">mini kind of GoPro the hero4 session</text><text start="21.9" dur="5.67">which is real awesome for taking like</text><text start="24.93" dur="4.2">any video outside but what I really want</text><text start="27.57" dur="6.41">to do with it is be able to take video</text><text start="29.13" dur="8.55">from the air unfortunately only have a</text><text start="33.98" dur="5.68">syma x5c which is not actually strong</text><text start="37.68" dur="4.86">enough to lift something like a gopro</text><text start="39.66" dur="6.57">even the light gopro like this by itself</text><text start="42.54" dur="6.03">the good news is that i have two of them</text><text start="46.23" dur="4.649">so i don&amp;#39;t know yet whether it&amp;#39;s going</text><text start="48.57" dur="5.04">to work but i&amp;#39;m going to attempt to tie</text><text start="50.879" dur="6.481">both of these together and actually fly</text><text start="53.61" dur="5.789">the gopro on a double drone don&amp;#39;t know</text><text start="57.36" dur="5.969">if that&amp;#39;s possible we&amp;#39;ll find out right</text><text start="59.399" dur="5.76">so the cyma by itself with all excess</text><text start="63.329" dur="8.451">weight stripped off without actually</text><text start="65.159" dur="11.521">like taking apart the frame weighs about</text><text start="71.78" dur="9.33">80 grams or gram force I guess because</text><text start="76.68" dur="4.43">it&amp;#39;s weight and the thrust</text><text start="98.47" dur="5.37">it&amp;#39;s about 108 Grand Forks</text><text start="105.01" dur="6.88">so to be safe subtract a little bit from</text><text start="108.11" dur="6.3">that we&amp;#39;ll say we sure we can get 90 or</text><text start="111.89" dur="6.12">maybe a hundred gram force of thrust out</text><text start="114.41" dur="6">of one silo with a new battery so not</text><text start="118.01" dur="4.98">only do these need to be able to combine</text><text start="120.41" dur="4.65">thrust but the control systems to</text><text start="122.99" dur="4.85">actually keep it stable and make it fly</text><text start="125.06" dur="5.64">where you want it to both need to work</text><text start="127.84" dur="6.04">when once they&amp;#39;re tied together so once</text><text start="130.7" dur="5.66">it&amp;#39;s actually an octocopter of sorts the</text><text start="133.88" dur="4.98">entertaining thing about the assignments</text><text start="136.36" dur="4.81">is that if you&amp;#39;re careful you can get</text><text start="138.86" dur="4.82">two of them to sync to the same</text><text start="141.17" dur="2.51">controller</text><text start="148.32" dur="5.26">except even once you do that they don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="151.06" dur="4.38">always do the same thing this one&amp;#39;s got</text><text start="153.58" dur="3.36">a lot more weight on it than this guy so</text><text start="155.44" dur="5.87">I&amp;#39;m going to strip them down and make</text><text start="156.94" dur="4.37">them as even as they can possibly be</text><text start="178.78" dur="7.09">now one of them is certainly a lot more</text><text start="183.62" dur="4.62">energetic than the other but the really</text><text start="185.87" dur="8.9">important thing is that they turn</text><text start="188.24" dur="11.85">together and they seem to be doing that</text><text start="194.77" dur="6.58">all right until that happens that&amp;#39;s kind</text><text start="200.09" dur="3.63">of what they look like in a minute</text><text start="201.35" dur="4.44">so to attach these two drones together</text><text start="203.72" dur="2.519">they can either go above each other like</text><text start="205.79" dur="2.61">that</text><text start="206.239" dur="4.041">and they&amp;#39;d probably get stuck in each</text><text start="208.4" dur="3.93">other&amp;#39;s downwash a little bit or</text><text start="210.28" dur="5.41">conversely they could go next to each</text><text start="212.33" dur="5.99">other or in front of each other either</text><text start="215.69" dur="5.28">way you&amp;#39;re gonna have the outermost</text><text start="218.32" dur="4.78">motors working really hard and it might</text><text start="220.97" dur="4.53">be kind of strange to see how it</text><text start="223.1" dur="4.41">stabilizes when that happens so either</text><text start="225.5" dur="4.14">go for less thrust and more stable or</text><text start="227.51" dur="4.56">more thrust and less stable I&amp;#39;m gonna</text><text start="229.64" dur="5.159">start sideways and just see what the</text><text start="232.07" dur="5.22">stability looks like and I think that to</text><text start="234.799" dur="5.511">start that I&amp;#39;m going to try to attach it</text><text start="237.29" dur="3.02">together with some skewers</text><text start="245.74" dur="2.06">you</text><text start="268.22" dur="7.44">all right this has to be the the</text><text start="271.17" dur="8.43">derpiest octocopter in history but</text><text start="275.66" dur="7">ideally these like the freight</text><text start="279.6" dur="4.62">controllers in both drones will sort of</text><text start="282.66" dur="7.23">correct for each other and keep the</text><text start="284.22" dur="7.74">entire assembly level and hopefully the</text><text start="289.89" dur="5.76">the the place where they will fight is</text><text start="291.96" dur="11.25">in rotation but hopefully they keep each</text><text start="295.65" dur="22.59">other level so we&amp;#39;ll find out oh yeah oh</text><text start="303.21" dur="24.02">man that&amp;#39;s floppy Wow oh shoot yes so</text><text start="318.24" dur="8.99">that&amp;#39;s not entirely stable Wow</text><text start="339.02" dur="13">very unstable all right</text><text start="343.819" dur="10.96">hmm okay so I had to go for the l&amp;#39;amour</text><text start="352.02" dur="5.13">thrust method first but that clearly</text><text start="354.779" dur="6">didn&amp;#39;t work so now I&amp;#39;m gonna try to</text><text start="357.15" dur="6.78">stack them and see if I can get them far</text><text start="360.779" dur="5.13">enough apart well first get it stable if</text><text start="363.93" dur="3.81">I can get it stable efj lying with two</text><text start="365.909" dur="4.44">coupled quadcopters I will be very happy</text><text start="367.74" dur="4.109">and then I need to get them far enough</text><text start="370.349" dur="4.5">apart that they don&amp;#39;t get stuck in each</text><text start="371.849" dur="5.37">other&amp;#39;s downwash and I actually get the</text><text start="374.849" dur="5.271">improvement in thrust that will let me</text><text start="377.219" dur="2.901">lift a GoPro</text><text start="386.26" dur="2.06">you</text><text start="406.29" dur="4.62">and if this doesn&amp;#39;t look destined to</text><text start="409.05" dur="11.94">fall out of the sky I&amp;#39;m not sure if</text><text start="410.91" dur="12.15">anything can all right here&amp;#39;s take two</text><text start="420.99" dur="5.03">with vertically stacked drones I also</text><text start="423.06" dur="2.96">have an audience this time</text><text start="435.719" dur="6.271">that&amp;#39;s not half bad it&amp;#39;s a lot better</text><text start="438.49" dur="3.5">that you should have seen the other one</text><text start="445.91" dur="8.4">shoot that almost looks like it was</text><text start="448.49" dur="15.23">supposed to be that way should I try to</text><text start="454.31" dur="9.41">do a flip right</text><text start="466.23" dur="7.55">oh it&amp;#39;s still not the easiest thing to</text><text start="471.24" dur="2.54">control</text><text start="501.16" dur="4.14">there were more rigid I think it would</text><text start="503.27" dur="2.03">work</text><text start="520.479" dur="6.481">no we could probably just threw it in</text><text start="524.15" dur="2.81">the air and get footage</text><text start="568.81" dur="4.87">okay so tying the drones together with</text><text start="571.79" dur="4.23">rigid supports did Network very well</text><text start="573.68" dur="3.69">because when the flight controllers were</text><text start="576.02" dur="3.18">fighting against each other all the</text><text start="577.37" dur="3.24">energy that was lost trying to keep the</text><text start="579.2" dur="4.01">thing stable meant that there actually</text><text start="580.61" dur="7.14">wasn&amp;#39;t enough thrust to hold the entire</text><text start="583.21" dur="6.76">assembly up so I last night started to</text><text start="587.75" dur="4.77">play with actually tying them together</text><text start="589.97" dur="4.05">with string with piece of tape down here</text><text start="592.52" dur="5.25">weighs as much as the camera does</text><text start="594.02" dur="6.15">exactly so that&amp;#39;s nice to test with but</text><text start="597.77" dur="6.18">I am encountering some problems with</text><text start="600.17" dur="4.98">this even because these drones they can</text><text start="603.95" dur="4.95">only apply thrust</text><text start="605.15" dur="7.32">I guess normal to their surface so you</text><text start="608.9" dur="4.89">got to try to put the string so that</text><text start="612.47" dur="4.38">when they&amp;#39;re pulling on it it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="613.79" dur="5.67">be exactly in that normal otherwise it</text><text start="616.85" dur="6.18">will fly off in one direction crazily</text><text start="619.46" dur="5.87">and that&amp;#39;s the problem that I&amp;#39;m fighting</text><text start="623.03" dur="2.3">right now</text><text start="633.33" dur="4.13">see</text><text start="634.86" dur="5.23">every time it is</text><text start="637.46" dur="6.3">it&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re playing as an inscription</text><text start="640.09" dur="5.82">and there&amp;#39;s very little way to control</text><text start="643.76" dur="2.15">it</text><text start="685.11" dur="6.37">so trying to tie two drones together in</text><text start="688.84" dur="4.65">order to lift a gopro was not as</text><text start="691.48" dur="4.5">successful as I&amp;#39;d hoped to put it mildly</text><text start="693.49" dur="4.53">although I did learn something about you</text><text start="695.98" dur="4.59">know how the drones will interact and it</text><text start="698.02" dur="4.83">was interesting but it still leaves me</text><text start="700.57" dur="5.82">with wanting to be able to take aerial</text><text start="702.85" dur="6.66">pictures with the GoPro so I cheated I</text><text start="706.39" dur="4.98">attached the the GoPro with the</text><text start="709.51" dur="5.67">floaties on it so that if it hits the</text><text start="711.37" dur="7.5">ground it&amp;#39;s not going to break to a clip</text><text start="715.18" dur="5.13">to a golf ball retriever and golf pro</text><text start="718.87" dur="3">retrievers are really great I always</text><text start="720.31" dur="4.08">carry one in my car in order to get</text><text start="721.87" dur="7.17">drone out of a tree if it gets stuck but</text><text start="724.39" dur="6.78">this has effectively become one of the</text><text start="729.04" dur="4.74">largest selfie sticks probably in</text><text start="731.17" dur="4.74">existence so I can just kind of hold</text><text start="733.78" dur="4.8">this in the air and take all the</text><text start="735.91" dur="6.56">pictures I want it&amp;#39;s not as good as the</text><text start="738.58" dur="3.89">drone but it&amp;#39;s pretty close</text></transcript>
