dur="4.84">fancy hats all of which are connected in</text><text start="15.24" dur="4.36">this horrifying org chart why so</text><text start="17.68" dur="3.599">complicated though the new

dur="3.561">oldest continuous government on the</text><text start="25.199" dur="3.84">island of Great Britain the city of</text><text start="26.92" dur="4.279">London predates the Empire that

dur="3.721">than a thousand years the city of</text><text start="46.079" dur="4.041">London&amp;#39;s government is so old that</text><text start="47.76" dur="4">there&amp;#39;s no surviving record of exactly</text><text start="50.12" dur="3.439">when it was born there are only</text><text start="51.76" dur="3.92">documents like the Magna Carta which</text><text start="53.559" dur="4.52">mention the pre-existing Powers the city</text><text start="55.68" dur="4.28">of London already had at that point in</text><text start="58.079" dur="3.48">time so while a government like the uned</text><text

dur="5.679">meaning that the city is so old it just</text><text start="73.119" dur="4.601">is and that age brings with it unusual</text><text start="75.759" dur="4.161">and complicated Traditions the most</text><text start="77.72" dur="5">notable of these perhaps is that in city</text><text start="79.92" dur="5.08">of London elections companies get votes</text><text start="82.72" dur="4.399">quite a lot actually about 34s of the</text><text start="85" dur="4.159">votes cast in City elections are from</text><text start="87.119" dur="3.721">companies with the remaining 1/4 from</text><text start="89.159" dur="3.681">residents the the way it works is that</text><text start="90.84" dur="3.88">the bigger a company is the more votes</text><text start="92.84" dur="3.48">it gets from the city of London the</text><text start="94.72" dur="3.719">companies then give their votes to</text><text start="96.32" dur="4.079">select employees who work but do not</text><text start="98.439" dur="4.241">live within the city and it&amp;#39;s these</text><text start="100.399" dur="4.121">employees who do the actual voting at</text><text start="102.68" dur="3.64">election time the result is

reasoning</text><text start="114.04" dur="3.88">behind this unusual tradition is that</text><text start="115.96" dur="4.799">for every one person who lives in the</text><text start="117.92" dur="5.96">city of London 43 people will commute in</text><text start="120.759" dur="5.4">every day in total that&amp;#39;s 300,000</text><text start="123.88" dur="4.4">commuters using city services

city of London but before</text><text start="160.08" dur="4.439">you can be Sheriff you need to be an</text><text start="161.92" dur="5.76">alderman what&amp;#39;s an alder well the city</text><text start="164.519" dur="5.041">of London is divided into 25 Wards and</text><text start="167.68" dur="4.04">each Ward elects one Alderman to</text><text start="169.56" dur="4.399">represent it on the court of alderman a</text><text start="171.72" dur="3.92">subsection of the common Council but</text><text start="173.959" dur="4.2">before you can run for Alderman you need</text><text start="175.64" dur="4.8">to gain Freeman status and who gives out</text><text start="178.159" dur="4.241">Freeman status why none other than the</text><text start="180.44" dur="4.519">very Court of alderman you&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="182.4" dur="4.759">get elected to which might just seem</text><text start="184.959" dur="3.961">like a conflict of interest luckily</text><text start="187.159" dur="4.44">there is another way to get Freeman</text><text start="188.92" dur="4.44">status Join one of the city&amp;#39;s guilds</text><text start="191.599" dur="3.601">sadly they aren&amp;#39;t called guilds they&amp;#39;re</text><text start="193.36" dur="3.879">called Livery companies a name which is</text><text start="195.2" dur="3.959">both more boring and less descriptive</text><text start="197.239" dur="3.841">but the remnants of medieval guilds many</text><text start="199.159" dur="4.36">of them are and within the city there</text><text start="201.08" dur="4.519">are 108 of them to choose from including</text><text start="203.519" dur="3.8">but not limited to the apothecaries the</text><text start="205.599" dur="3.36">fishmongers the Masons the Mercers the</text><text start="207.319" dur="2.761">scientific instrument makers the bankers</text><text start="208.959" dur="2.321">the ship writs the wheel writes The</text><text start="210.08" dur="3.2">Butchers The Bakers two different</text><text start="211.28" dur="4.8">Candlestick makers and the most exciting</text><text start="213.28" dur="4.48">of all the Chartered Accountants many of</text><text start="216.08" dur="3.439">these guilds like the Fletchers have</text><text start="217.76" dur="3.6">become Charities but some are still</text><text start="219.519" dur="3.561">active such as the goldsmiths who test</text><text start="221.36" dur="3.959">the quality of British coinage and the</text><text start="223.08" dur="4">hacky Carriage drivers who license taxi</text><text start="225.319" dur="2.881">drivers to join one of these guilds</text><text start="227.08" dur="2.84">you&amp;#39;ll either need to meet the</text><text start="228.2" dur="3.44">professional requirements or for the</text><text start="229.92" dur="3.48">Charities like the haberdashers you&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="231.64" dur="3.599">need the approval of two existing</text><text start="233.4" dur="3.36">members if you meet none of the Livery</text><text start="235.239" dur="3.041">company&amp;#39;s membership requirements but</text><text start="236.76" dur="3.52">you think you&amp;#39;ll be a clever clogs and</text><text start="238.28" dur="3.959">start your own Livery company and Grant</text><text start="240.28" dur="3.64">yourself Freeman status tough luck</text><text start="242.239" dur="3.801">because new livery companies need to be</text><text start="243.92" dur="4.12">approved by you guessed it the court of</text><text start="246.04" dur="3.72">alderman but let&amp;#39;s assume one way or</text><text start="248.04" dur="3.96">another you get the official Freeman</text><text start="249.76" dur="4.88">status certificate now you can finally</text><text start="252" dur="4.44">run for Alderman of award after the Lord</text><text start="254.64" dur="3.76">Chancellor&amp;#39;s advisory committee also</text><text start="256.44" dur="3.919">approves of you but that small barrier</text><text start="258.4" dur="3.6">passed you can win election as Alderman</text><text start="260.359" dur="3.84">in either one of the four WS where</text><text start="262" dur="3.96">people live or the 21 wards where</text><text start="264.199" dur="3.44">companies live once on the court of</text><text start="265.96" dur="3.4">alderman to continue your path to the</text><text start="267.639" dur="3.881">mayor&amp;#39;s office in Guild Hall you must</text><text start="269.36" dur="3.839">now be elected as Sheriff but this time</text><text start="271.52" dur="3.92">it&amp;#39;s the members of The Livery companies</text><text start="273.199" dur="4.041">who pick the sheriffs so if the Livery</text><text start="275.44" dur="3.28">company members elect you as Sheriff</text><text start="277.24" dur="3.76">after you have successfully completed</text><text start="278.72" dur="4.36">your term then you can finally run for</text><text start="281" dur="4.039">mayor but surprisingly residents of the</text><text start="283.08" dur="4.04">city of London don&amp;#39;t vote for the mayor</text><text start="285.039" dur="4.321">our old friends on the court of alderman</text><text start="287.12" dur="3.799">do so in summary once you get your</text><text start="289.36" dur="3.399">Freeman status from either the court of</text><text start="290.919" dur="3.681">alderman or the Livery companies and</text><text start="292.759" dur="3.401">after your ward elects you as Alderman</text><text start="294.6" dur="3.159">and then the Livery companies elect you</text><text start="296.16" dur="3.16">as sheriff and after your term as</text><text start="297.759" dur="3.841">Sheriff ends but while you&amp;#39;re still on</text><text start="299.32" dur="4.159">the court of alderman then you can run</text><text start="301.6" dur="4.159">for mayor and assuming the other</text><text start="303.479" dur="4.601">Alderman select you you can finally take</text><text start="305.759" dur="5.681">your place as the right honorable the</text><text start="308.08" dur="6.16">Lord mayor of London for one year with</text><text start="311.44" dur="4.319">no salary and you have to cover your own</text><text start="314.24" dur="3.2">expenses which will be quite</text><text start="315.759" dur="3.401">considerable as your new job consists</text><text start="317.44" dur="3.56">mostly of making hundreds of speeches a</text><text start="319.16" dur="4.68">year around the world promoting City</text><text start="321"
