start="4.23" dur="4.05">cinder blocks and a baby sledge and</text><text start="6.54" dur="10.68">we&amp;#39;re gonna find out exactly how tough</text><text start="8.28" dur="10.68">this knife is guys I&amp;#39;m really excited to</text><text start="17.22" dur="3.3">do this video cuz I have a lot of fond</text><text start="18.96" dur="4.229">memories of buck knives like a lot of</text><text start="20.52" dur="4.65">you guys a buck knife was my first real</text><text start="23.189" dur="5.91">knife so let me show you this brand new</text><text start="25.17" dur="8.36">buck 110 comes with this leather sheath</text><text start="29.099" dur="9.39">and look at that isn&amp;#39;t that beautiful</text><text start="33.53" dur="7">mmm crisp firm action on that just fits</text><text start="38.489" dur="4.051">in the hand very nicely it&amp;#39;s a large</text><text start="40.53" dur="4.17">pocket knife one thing I really like</text><text start="42.54" dur="4.47">about the buck 110 is its classic look</text><text start="44.7" dur="4.41">you know the brass and the wood handle</text><text start="47.01" dur="4.2">it seems like every single knife on the</text><text start="49.11" dur="4.019">market nowadays is a tactical pocket</text><text start="51.21" dur="3.72">knife you know I&amp;#39;m not a member of SEAL</text><text start="53.129" dur="4.531">team 6 I&amp;#39;m not going to be stabbing</text><text start="54.93" dur="5.399">terrorists with this I don&amp;#39;t see a point</text><text start="57.66" dur="5.25">in pretending it&amp;#39;s a military weapon now</text><text start="60.329" dur="5.01">the buck 110 is a lock blade pocket</text><text start="62.91" dur="5.1">knife you open it up and it clicks into</text><text start="65.339" dur="6.151">place and then it&amp;#39;s locked it will not</text><text start="68.01" dur="5.37">unfold until you hit the button there on</text><text start="71.49" dur="4.29">the back one way to judge the</text><text start="73.38" dur="5.25">craftsmanship of a pocket knife is how</text><text start="75.78" dur="5.79">much play there is in the blade and</text><text start="78.63" dur="6">these buck knives up and down there is</text><text start="81.57" dur="8.49">zero play you cannot wiggle that at all</text><text start="84.63" dur="8.52">side to side just ever so slightly you</text><text start="90.06" dur="5.96">can detect a little bit of play but very</text><text start="93.15" dur="5.46">very little this thing is put together</text><text start="96.02" dur="4.75">extremely well now the buck knife comes</text><text start="98.61" dur="5.42">straight from the factory razor-sharp</text><text start="100.77" dur="3.26">look at this</text><text start="115.09" dur="4.48">getting a little close to my fingers</text><text start="117.05" dur="4.8">there oh great now you&amp;#39;re gonna pick up</text><text start="119.57" dur="3.99">all this paper well there&amp;#39;s been a lot</text><text start="121.85" dur="3.78">of yakety-yak in this video now it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="123.56" dur="3.75">time to test how durable the buck 110</text><text start="125.63" dur="3.81">really is and the first thing we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="127.31" dur="4.35">gonna test is this ability to maintain a</text><text start="129.44" dur="4.2">sharp edge now I already showed you how</text><text start="131.66" dur="4.35">sharp it is coming out of the box let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="133.64" dur="4.29">see how well it can hold that edge I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="136.01" dur="3.57">gonna make a big pile of shavings here</text><text start="137.93" dur="4.08">and then we&amp;#39;re gonna do the paper test</text><text start="139.58" dur="19.89">and see if it maintains that razor-sharp</text><text start="142.01" dur="19.86">edge cutting up these wood shavings was</text><text start="159.47" dur="3.84">so easy with this knife it absolutely</text><text start="161.87" dur="4.05">chewed through this wood like a chainsaw</text><text start="163.31" dur="13.86">and now let&amp;#39;s see how much of an edge it</text><text start="165.92" dur="13.289">still has well guys that knife is still</text><text start="177.17" dur="4.319">razor-sharp and that&amp;#39;s what buck knives</text><text start="179.209" dur="4.441">are known for maintaining a sharp edge</text><text start="181.489" dur="4.231">even under extreme abuse and they do</text><text start="183.65" dur="4.47">this by using high-quality steel and</text><text start="185.72" dur="4.53">then hardening it correctly which can be</text><text start="188.12" dur="4.14">quite complicated and time-consuming and</text><text start="190.25" dur="3.72">these guys have got it down to a science</text><text start="192.26" dur="3.39">they&amp;#39;ve been doing this for over a</text><text start="193.97" dur="3.269">hundred years well we know the buck</text><text start="195.65" dur="5.73">knife can hold an edge but let&amp;#39;s see how</text><text start="197.239" dur="6.991">durable it is alright so we&amp;#39;ve got a</text><text start="201.38" dur="4.77">number 10 can of garbanzo beans here and</text><text start="204.23" dur="4.56">I&amp;#39;m going to demonstrate another common</text><text start="206.15" dur="5.61">use for my favorite camp knives you know</text><text start="208.79" dur="5.46">the can opener was invented 50 years</text><text start="211.76" dur="6.57">after the invention of the tin can so</text><text start="214.25" dur="6.769">back then you wanted to open it up you</text><text start="218.33" dur="2.689">did it this way</text><text start="229.5" dur="5.17">there you go cut through the tin can</text><text start="232.84" dur="3.81">like butter alright got these chunks of</text><text start="234.67" dur="4.59">cinder blocks here you got my baby</text><text start="236.65" dur="11.49">sledge we&amp;#39;re gonna find out exactly how</text><text start="239.26" dur="12.05">tough this edge is look at that let&amp;#39;s</text><text start="248.14" dur="3.17">see what else we can do</text><text start="269.85" dur="21.73">look at that got the sword and the stone</text><text start="284.41" dur="8.46">here going oh look at that guys look at</text><text start="291.58" dur="5.04">the top of the blade there&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="292.87" dur="6.24">mushrooming no dents no major scratches</text><text start="296.62" dur="4.2">from hitting it with a baby sledge well</text><text start="299.11" dur="3.66">that definitely put some Nicks in the</text><text start="300.82" dur="5.67">blade but that was pretty awesome that</text><text start="302.77" dur="5.43">thing cut into a cinderblock the knife</text><text start="306.49" dur="4.23">was literally stuck in the cinderblock</text><text start="308.2" dur="14.31">there for a little bit that was pretty</text><text start="310.72" dur="14.55">cool that definitely affected the</text><text start="322.51" dur="7.22">sharpness all right let&amp;#39;s split some</text><text start="325.27" dur="4.46">kindling here okay</text><text start="335.94" dur="20.45">oh this is so bad to do with the pocket</text><text start="354.24" dur="2.15">knife</text><text start="372.689" dur="8.16">Oh busted off the lock mechanism that</text><text start="379.469" dur="3.18">little piece of metal that goes right</text><text start="380.849" dur="4.37">there just bust it off it&amp;#39;s probably</text><text start="382.649" dur="6.75">laying around down here somewhere</text><text start="385.219" dur="6.22">there we go I gotta tell you I&amp;#39;m really</text><text start="389.399" dur="4.74">sad to see this knife get broken is a</text><text start="391.439" dur="4.83">great knife but I can tell you from</text><text start="394.139" dur="3.81">years of experience breaking pocket</text><text start="396.269" dur="3.54">knives that there are a couple really</text><text start="397.949" dur="4.86">great ways to jack up a pocketknife</text><text start="399.809" dur="4.71">first off holding it and trying to split</text><text start="402.809" dur="4.32">wood by beating the back of it like you</text><text start="404.519" dur="4.77">saw me do that&amp;#39;s not good</text><text start="407.129" dur="4.5">most the time if you&amp;#39;re use smaller</text><text start="409.289" dur="4.56">pieces of wood it won&amp;#39;t break the metal</text><text start="411.629" dur="4.89">but it&amp;#39;ll get progressively more and</text><text start="413.849" dur="4.74">more wiggle in the blade until it</text><text start="416.519" dur="4.17">doesn&amp;#39;t lock properly it wears down the</text><text start="418.589" dur="4.8">locking mechanism really fast</text><text start="420.689" dur="4.95">the second way it&amp;#39;s you can break pocket</text><text start="423.389" dur="4.17">knives very easily is by throwing them</text><text start="425.639" dur="4.2">when I was a kid I did that with my</text><text start="427.559" dur="3.78">first buck knife and I put that blade</text><text start="429.839" dur="3.18">point first into the ground and there</text><text start="431.339" dur="3.75">was a rock under there they hit that</text><text start="433.019" dur="4.47">rock and broke off about a sixteenth of</text><text start="435.089" dur="3.99">an inch off the tip of my knife well</text><text start="437.489" dur="3.69">guys I hope you enjoyed this video and</text><text start="439.079" dur="3.54">learned something new if you want to see</text><text start="441.179"
