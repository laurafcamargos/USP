dur="3.871">water demo you should go watch that</text><text start="15.42" dur="3.72">first because this video is just a</text><text start="17.34" dur="3.93">really quick explanation for how to set</text><text start="19.14" dur="4.469">up the experiment you need a clear</text><text start="21.27" dur="5.22">bottle that can support - one atmosphere</text><text start="23.609" dur="4.981">without collapsing a tube at least 40</text><text start="26.49" dur="4.049">feet long that can support - one</text><text start="28.59" dur="4.35">atmosphere without collapsing and a</text><text start="30.539" dur="4.831">five-gallon bucket to use as a base and</text><text start="32.94" dur="4.41">to purge your hose of air bubbles and</text><text start="35.37" dur="3.81">enough fittings and sealant to put</text><text start="37.35" dur="3.779">everything together I originally wanted</text><text start="39.18" dur="4.35">a garden hose but for fear of it</text><text start="41.129" dur="3.901">collapsing and sealing off and because I</text><text start="43.53" dur="3.81">like to be able to see where the water</text><text start="45.03" dur="4.95">is in the clear pipe I settled on this</text><text start="47.34" dur="4.41">rather more industrial tubing if you</text><text start="49.98" dur="3.03">can&amp;#39;t squeeze it shut with your fingers</text><text start="51.75" dur="3.329">it&amp;#39;s probably strong enough</text><text start="53.01" dur="4.619">unfortunately at Home Depot this stuff</text><text start="55.079" dur="4.5">only came in 25 foot lengths so I got a</text><text start="57.629" dur="3.93">couple of these compression couplers to</text><text start="59.579" dur="3.991">attach them with a pretty good seal I</text><text start="61.559" dur="4.231">was initially thinking of the slip fit</text><text start="63.57" dur="4.02">plastic couplers but for an extra couple</text><text start="65.79" dur="4.2">bucks I went with the brass fitting I</text><text start="67.59" dur="4.68">trust completely once swage down tightly</text><text start="69.99" dur="4.62">of course I say trust completely</text><text start="72.27" dur="4.139">and one of my fittings was not in fact</text><text start="74.61" dur="4.68">tight enough and halfway through filming</text><text start="76.409" dur="4.71">it started to leak so because I didn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="79.29" dur="4.11">have a second wrench to tighten the</text><text start="81.119" dur="4.89">thing I just sort of smothered it in</text><text start="83.4" dur="5.399">extra sealant and pretty quickly stopped</text><text start="86.009" dur="5.101">bubbling the Nalgene cap surprisingly</text><text start="88.799" dur="3.901">enough creates an excellent seal which</text><text start="91.11" dur="3.48">makes it really easy to refill the</text><text start="92.7" dur="4.08">bottle but you still need to connect the</text><text start="94.59" dur="4.38">hose to it so I drilled a hole through</text><text start="96.78" dur="4.44">the cap and did an extremely terrible</text><text start="98.97" dur="4.05">job of hand threading the hole by</text><text start="101.22" dur="4.38">shoving the swage fitting through it</text><text start="103.02" dur="5.309">with a wrench funny enough that had some</text><text start="105.6" dur="5.04">leaks so I went with some rubber sealant</text><text start="108.329" dur="3.9">I don&amp;#39;t know how important this actually</text><text start="110.64" dur="4.049">would be but after some googling I</text><text start="112.229" dur="4.17">decided to not get silicone sealant</text><text start="114.689" dur="4.261">because apparently when it cures it can</text><text start="116.399" dur="4.441">actually etch brass and degrade the seal</text><text start="118.95" dur="3.349">once you have the apparatus built you</text><text start="120.84" dur="4.08">need to find a suitable location</text><text start="122.299" dur="4.78">stairwells with big open insides were</text><text start="124.92" dur="4.11">great I just decided to film in this</text><text start="127.079" dur="4.111">particular stairway because it was open</text><text start="129.03" dur="4.56">to the outside - and that made it</text><text start="131.19" dur="3.75">a bit easier to film you also want to</text><text start="133.59" dur="4.05">make sure you do this somewhere it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="134.94" dur="4.92">okay to spill a load of water inside on</text><text start="137.64" dur="4.56">a tile floor would be a very bad idea</text><text start="139.86" dur="4.47">what I was expecting to be the most</text><text start="142.2" dur="4.47">frustrating part of the experiment was</text><text start="144.33" dur="3.96">purging the air out of the lines but</text><text start="146.67" dur="3.36">this actually turned out to be really</text><text start="148.29" dur="3.66">easy because you can use the water</text><text start="150.03" dur="5.16">pressure difference to make the lines</text><text start="151.95" dur="4.89">empty themselves of air set up a siphon</text><text start="155.19" dur="3.72">by filling the end of the tube with</text><text start="156.84" dur="4.53">water then quickly drape it over the</text><text start="158.91" dur="5.07">wall of the bucket so the entire hose is</text><text start="161.37" dur="5.1">below the water level in the bucket all</text><text start="163.98" dur="4.38">the water will flow out carrying any air</text><text start="166.47" dur="4.26">bubbles with it once all your air is</text><text start="168.36" dur="5.61">gone you can plug the end and return it</text><text start="170.73" dur="4.95">to the bucket now you have a closed loop</text><text start="173.97" dur="4.08">of tubing that&amp;#39;s completely full of</text><text start="175.68" dur="5.28">water with no air bubbles and that loop</text><text start="178.05" dur="5.04">both begins and ends submerged in the</text><text start="180.96" dur="5.03">bucket now just put the water bottle in</text><text start="183.09" dur="4.86">fill it up and screw on the cap</text><text start="185.99" dur="4.6">underwater while everything is</text><text start="187.95" dur="4.92">completely submerged and just like that</text><text start="190.59" dur="4.23">you&amp;#39;re ready to go you&amp;#39;ve got a bottle</text><text start="192.87" dur="3.78">that is completely purged of air bubbles</text><text start="194.82" dur="4.08">connect to a hose that is completely</text><text start="196.65" dur="4.14">purged of air bubbles as a final note</text><text start="198.9" dur="4.65">you&amp;#39;re probably gonna want to tape the</text><text start="200.79" dur="4.919">other end of the hose into the bucket</text><text start="203.55" dur="4.11">because if it comes loose then you get</text><text start="205.709" dur="3.901">air up in the line and it solve all</text><text start="207.66" dur="3.93">kinds of frustrating this again</text><text start="209.61" dur="3.99">walk up the stairs carrying the bottle</text><text start="211.59" dur="4.619">and eventually you should see it start</text><text start="213.6" dur="5.01">boiling but the real question is how far</text><text start="216.209" dur="4.261">up do you need to go for that you need</text><text start="218.61" dur="3.75">to know two things the temperature of</text><text start="220.47" dur="3.93">the water and the barometric pressure</text><text start="222.36" dur="4.05">from your local weather report find the</text><text start="224.4" dur="4.5">current pressure normally reported in</text><text start="226.41" dur="4.859">inches of mercury and convert that to</text><text start="228.9" dur="5.64">inches of water it should be somewhere</text><text start="231.269" dur="5.371">around 400 next lookup the vapor</text><text start="234.54" dur="4.919">pressure of water at your temperature</text><text start="236.64" dur="5.76">it&amp;#39;ll probably be in PSI tour or</text><text start="239.459" dur="6.06">Pascal&amp;#39;s but convert that to inches of</text><text start="242.4" dur="5.58">water as well subtract the water vapor</text><text start="245.519" dur="5.041">pressure column height from the</text><text start="247.98" dur="4.8">barometric pressure water column height</text><text start="250.56" dur="4.83">and you should get the boiling height</text><text start="252.78" dur="4.769">measured from the top of the surface of</text><text start="255.39" dur="4.5">the water in the bucket this height is</text><text start="257.549" dur="3.171">what I had marked as the green arrow in</text><text start="259.89" dur="3.8">my</text><text start="260.72" dur="4.65">video the higher above this line you</text><text start="263.69" dur="4.74">bring the water bottle the more</text><text start="265.37" dur="4.5">vigorously the water will boil but you</text><text start="268.43" dur="3.84">have to remember that that means the</text><text start="269.87" dur="5.16">water in the hose is also going to be</text><text start="272.27" dur="6.12">boiling so if you are boiling the water</text><text start="275.03" dur="5.61">in the hose and then there&amp;#39;s expanding</text><text start="278.39" dur="4.14">water vapor in the bottle itself it&amp;#39;s</text><text start="280.64" dur="4.29">going to push those bubbles down the</text><text start="282.53" dur="5.79">tube and you&amp;#39;re going to get a mix of</text><text start="284.93" dur="5.31">vapor and water in the tube itself and</text><text start="288.32" dur="3.84">that might cause problems from the</text><text start="290.24" dur="4.65">experiment so it&amp;#39;s just something to</text><text start="292.16" dur="5.19">keep in mind it&amp;#39;s also worth noting that</text><text start="294.89" dur="4.35">unless you&amp;#39;re using crazy pure water</text><text start="297.35" dur="3.87">you&amp;#39;re going to get bubbles of other</text><text start="299.24" dur="4.71">gases evaporating out of the water</text><text start="301.22" dur="4.8">before the water itself begins to boil</text><text start="303.95" dur="4.2">if you want to clear these bubbles out</text><text start="306.02" dur="3.78">you can bring the water to just under</text><text start="308.15" dur="4.11">its boiling point and then back down a</text><text start="309.8" dur="4.8">few times to consolidate all of the</text><text start="312.26" dur="4.29">other gas bubbles at the top of the</text><text start="314.6" dur="4.2">bottle hope you have fun boiling</text><text start="316.55" dur="8.36">room-temperature water with more water</text><text start="318.8" dur="6.11">thanks for watching that&amp;#39;s so weird</text><text start="329.79" dur="21.43">[Music]</text><text start="349.16" dur="2.06">you</text></transcript>
