(granted most of the ground is missing). Considering it's my first attempt at such a technique, I'm really happy with how it all turned out! The first time I put a test cut into the rift the other day I was pretty amazed. Hope you enjoy!\n\nEven starting with a 4k*2k image, the resolution is limited because the Rift's HMD is limited, but it still feels like you're standing there and time went nuts, which I think is pretty cool. The lens flare does map out pretty weirdly at night, and the spherical stretching heavily exaggerates my lens' chromatic aberration, resulting in some dark blue fringes near sharp edges on trees and in the observatory, but those are problems to solve with more coding at a later date. \n\nThis video is the \"sphericalized\" version of this timelapse: https://youtu.be/4c1VRMUBh_4\n\nEQUIPMENT\nCamera: Sony a6000\nLens: Lensbaby Circular Fisheye (185° FOV, set to f/5.8)\nCamera Power Supply: Case Relay (with AC-5V adapter)\nAnti-dew lens heater: DIY - resistive heater (2.7W)\nCamera cover: DIY - plastic bags and blue tape\n\n\nSETTINGS\nExternal Intervalometer: 1:20 per exposure\nMode: Aperture Priority\nShutter Speeds: (1/4000 to 30)\nISO: Auto (100-800)\nMetering: Center*\nExposure Comp: ±0.0\nWhite Balance: AWB\nLong exposure noise removal (In camera dark frame): ON\n\n*Center metering caused glitches when moon was directly overhead → painful Matlab repair.\n\n\nPROCESSING\nIn-Camera: Captured as RAW\nLightroom 5: Processed separately for both day and night optimization\nMATLAB: custom deflickering routines for nighttime shots\nDaVinci Resolve 14: Blending, final grading, and looping\n\nMusic in this video:\n\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)\nhttp://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\nVespers by Topher Mohr and Alex Elena is licensed under a Creative Commons license","is_live":false}
