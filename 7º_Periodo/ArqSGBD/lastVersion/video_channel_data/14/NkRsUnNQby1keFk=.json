(like I expect anybody to watch it front to back...)\n\nThe simulation is based off of the \"Energy Verlet\" molecular dynamics method. I wrote it in Matlab to run on a 1060 6GB GPU. By the time all the particles are in the simulation, the program makes multiple trips to the graphics card for every timestep or else runs out of graphics memory. massively parallel computation requires a LOT of memory, apparently... There is no sub-binning of the simulation. Every pair of particles has its forces calculated in every timestep. Although far-apart particles don't apply a lot of force on each other, I couldn't make a more efficient system to only solve for adjacent particles that was better than calculating all the inter-pair distances in one line of code... For 16000 particles, that's something like 250 million square roots that need to be calculated every timestep, let alone the actual force vectors after you figure out how far apart everything is...\n\nThe particles obey a sum of the Lennard Jones potential (so that particles don't go through each other) and the Coulomb potential (so that red and blue attract and like colors repel). Even with these two perfectly \"spherical\" potentials, an ordered 3D structure forms, with both a crystal lattice and habit. \n\nSince a couple comments were asking for it, I cleaned up my code a bit and have it posted here.
