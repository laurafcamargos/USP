Check them out!\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/3Blue1Brown/comments/cvpdn7/make_your_own_fourier_circle_drawings/\nhttps://isaacvr.github.io/coding/fourier_transform/\n\nThanks to Stuart@Biocinematics for the one-line sketch of Fourier via twitter.  As it happens, he also has an educational YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKOiJd9YCbv7LeL2LFOGiLQ\n\nSmall correction: at 9:33, all the exponents should have a pi^2 in them.\n\nIf you're looking for more Fourier Series content online, including code to play with to create this kind of animation yourself, check out these posts:\n\nMathologer\nhttps://youtu.be/qS4H6PEcCCA\n\nThe Coding Train\nhttps://youtu.be/Mm2eYfj0SgA\n\nJezmoon\nhttp://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html\n\nFor those of you into pure math looking to really dig into the analysis behind this topic, you might want to take a look at Stein Shakarchi's book \"Fourier Analysis: An Introduction\"\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Drawing with circles\n2:10 - The heat equation\n6:25 - Interpreting infinite function sums\n9:52 - Trig in the complex plane\n14:11 - Summing complex exponentials\n22:11 - Example: The step function\n23:54 - Conclusion\n\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using a custom open-source python library, manim.  See the FAQ comments here:\nhttps://www.3blue1brown.com/faq#manim\nhttps://github.com/3b1b/manim\nhttps://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/\n\nYou can find code for specific videos and projects here:\nhttps://github.com/3b1b/videos/\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
