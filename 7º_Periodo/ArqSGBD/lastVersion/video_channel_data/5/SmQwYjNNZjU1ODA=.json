Consciousness, the name we give to that experience, can’t yet be explained — but science is at least beginning to understand it. In this episode, the consciousness researcher Anil Seth and host Steven Strogatz discuss why our perceptions can be described as a “controlled hallucination,” how consciousness played into the internet sensation known as “the dress,” and how people at home can help researchers catalog the full range of ways that we experience the world.\n\n- Anil Seth's website: https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p22981-anil-seth\n- View \"The dress\" illusion for yourself: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-31656935\n\n---------\n“The Joy of Why” is a Quanta Magazine podcast about curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge. The mathematician and author Steven Strogatz and the astrophysicist and author Janna Levin take turns interviewing leading researchers about the great scientific and mathematical questions of our time. \n\n- Listen to more episodes of Joy of Why: https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/the-joy-of-why/\n----------\n- VISIT our website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n- LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/QuantaNews\n- FOLLOW us Twitter: https://twitter.com/QuantaMagazine\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation: https://www.simonsfoundation.org/","is_live":false}
