conjectures that predicted a correspondence between two objects from completely different fields of math. The Langlands program was born. Today, it's one of the most ambitious mathematical feats ever attempted. Its symmetries imply deep, powerful and beautiful connections between the most important branches of mathematics. Many mathematicians agree that it has the potential to solve some of math's most intractable problems, in time, becoming a kind of “grand unified theory of mathematics,\" as the mathematician Edward Frenkel has described it. In a new video explainer, Rutgers University mathematician Alex Kontorovich takes us on a journey through the continents of mathematics to learn about the awe-inspiring symmetries at the heart of the Langlands program, including how Andrew Wiles solved Fermat's Last Theorem.\n\nRead more at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-the-langlands-program-20220531/\n\n00:00 A map of the mathematical world\n00:25 The land of Number Theory\"\n00:39 The continent of Harmonic Analysis\n01:20 A bridge: the Langlands Program\n01:46 Robert Langlands' conjectures link the two worlds\n02:40 Ramanujan Discriminant Function\n03:00 Modular Forms\n04:36 Pierre Deligne's proof of Ramanujan's conjecture\n04:47 Functoriality\n05:03 Pierre De Fermat's Last Theorem\n06:13 Andrew Wiles builds a bridge\n06:30 Elliptic curves\n07:07 Modular arithmetic\n08:56 Infinite power series\n09:20 Taniyama - Shimura - Weil conjecture\n10:40 Frey's counterexample to Frey's last theorem\n11:30 Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem\n\n- VISIT our Website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n- LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/QuantaNews\n- FOLLOW us Twitter: https://twitter.com/QuantaMagazine\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation https://www.simonsfoundation.org/","is_live":false}
