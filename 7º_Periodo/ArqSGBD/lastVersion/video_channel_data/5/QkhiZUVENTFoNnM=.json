explores connections between math, nature and the arts including architecture, music, design and literature. Wherever she looks, Hart discovers hidden patterns and symmetries which appeal to our innate appreciation of order and beauty in the universe. Hart is the professor of geometry at Gresham College in London, where she delivers several public lectures per year.\n\nRead the full article : https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-theorist-who-sees-math-in-art-music-and-writing-20240112/\n\n00:00 Humans are detectors of hidden math\n00:41 Group theory, the study of symmetry\n01:00 Math in nature: Fibonacci sequences and the golden ratio\n01:49 Symmetries in design, 17 patterns of wallpapers, and crystal structures\n03:35 Connections between music and math\n\n- VISIT our Website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n- LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/QuantaNews\n- FOLLOW us Twitter: https://twitter.com/QuantaMagazine\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation: https://www.simonsfoundation.org/","is_live":false}
