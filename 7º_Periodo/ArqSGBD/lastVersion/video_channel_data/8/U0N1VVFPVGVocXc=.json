In this video I print some parts, coat them in resin, and chemically silver that resin surface, making a first-surface mirror akin to telescope optics but MUCH less precise. (also I use said silvering process to make a play button with actual silver!) Hope you enjoy the classic story of scientific failure and iteration, and maybe learn something about mirrors while you're here!\n\nIf anybody is curious to try this themselves, this is very much not a sponsored video, but I was using Smooth-On's XTC-3D as my smoothing agent and Angel Guilding's Spray-Silvering chemicals to deposit the silver. if anybody knows more about these products that might explain some of the difficulties I've had, I'd be all ears!\n\n\nTechnique loosely based on this very interesting paper from  Vaidya and Solgaard:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/326424393_3D_printed_optics_with_nanometer_scale_surface_roughness\n\n\nMusic Credits, etc.:\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nhttp://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\nArcadia - Wonders by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100326\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nTill With Bell.wav from Benboncan is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license\n\nArecibo Telescope picture - David Broad","is_live":false}
