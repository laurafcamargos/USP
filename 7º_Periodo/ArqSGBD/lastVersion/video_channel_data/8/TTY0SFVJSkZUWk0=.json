famous (infamous?) \"windmill\" problem on the 2011 IMO\nHelp fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown\nAn equally valuable form of support is to simply share some of the videos.\nSpecial thanks to these supporters: http://3b1b.co/windmillthanks\nHome page: https://www.3blue1brown.com\n\nThe author of this problem was Geoff Smith.  You can find the full list of problems considered for the IMO that year, together with their solutions, here:\nhttps://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2011SL.pdf\n\nYou can find data for past IMO results here:\nhttps://www.imo-official.org/\n\nViewer-created interactive about this problem:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/3Blue1Brown/comments/d0b0qw/interactive_windmill_visual_program_download_link/\n\nAnd another:\nhttps://aalluri7.github.io/windmill/\n\nI made a quick reference to \"proper time\" as an example of an invariant.  Take a look at this minutephysics video if you want to learn more.\nhttps://youtu.be/WFAEHKAR5hU\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open-source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
