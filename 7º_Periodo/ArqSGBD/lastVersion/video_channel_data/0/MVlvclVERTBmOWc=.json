of nature from the world and play that frame on a loop? I do! and I've been trying to figure out the best way to take full-day loopable timelapses for a few years now. \n\nAs good weather aligned with a pre-planned hiking trip, I had the awesome opportunity to film a timelapse from Santa Cruz Islands, in Channel Islands National Park off the coast of southern California. Other than the ranger station on the island, I don't think there was a permanent human structure within 20 miles of my camera, and Ventura was behind me to the north, so the southern sky was DARK, and the night sky was awesome! The camera ran for a total of 25 hours and 52 minutes, and I spliced the footage back on itself to create a looping day-long timelapse.\n\nI'd been meaning to make a video about shooting 24-hour timelapses because I've done a bunch now and it's a really satisfying technique, so here it is! The full tutorial! I'm going to go through the entire process, front-to-back, that I used to create this timelapse, starting with planning and location selection before I left the mainland, and ending with post-processing and video looping in daVinci Resolve.\n\nIn between I'll hit everything about physically recording the timelapse, including my equipment setup, camera settings, weatherproofing, and mounting. Once you've got more than a thousand raw files, It also takes a solid day to edit (largely AFK lightroom rendering time but still...) and I go into my complete day-to-night-and-back timelapse workflow. Hope you enjoy!\n\nI really love the technique so if you film such a timelapse, let me know cause I'll want to watch!\n\n\nMusic Credits:\n\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)\nhttp://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\nNew Land by ALBIS is licensed under a Creative Commons license","is_live":false}
