You wouldn't think that crystalline materials like metals could deform without destroying the atomic pattern that gives them their strength and electronic properties, but with the help of a crystal defect called a dislocation, it's super easy. Dislocations are agents of plastic deformation, traveling through crystals and enabling malleability and ductility in soft metals like copper, making them great raw materials!
