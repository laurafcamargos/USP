Knead the dough aggressively for 8 to 10 minutes or until it is no longer sticky and can be stretched until it is almost see through. \nRoll into a ball and let sit for 45 minutes or until the ball doubles in volume. (this depends a lot on temperature of dough)\nKnock the big air bubbles out of the dough but kneading it a few times and then cut into loaf sized balls. Let it prove for another 45 minutes or until it doubles in volume again. Coat in flour, put on rock. \nOven should be between 400 to 500 F. Bake until golden brown. Rotate loaf in oven if necessary. Should take between 10 to 30 minutes depending on temperature. \nLet hot loaf sit until moderately warm to the touch and then slice and serve.\n\nRump Roast Recipe\nPut rump roast on spit and coat in liberal amounts of Montreal Steak Seasoning.
