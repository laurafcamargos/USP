metal","chapters":[],"likes":1399,"description":"Here's my version of the iconic character from Rick and Morty, the butter delivery robot! He's made from aluminum, brass, and stainless steel, and is proportioned to match the butter bot of the cartoon. (which actually mean's he's really short!)\n\nThis video shows the entire design and build process, from a screen grab of the cartoon  to the finished metal robot himself, and all of the CAD, machining, cutting, grinding, turning, and 3D printing in between. Hope you enjoy!\n\nLet me know what I did wrong in the comments! I'm pretty new to most of the metalworking techniques shown and I'd love some feedback if I'm portraying anything badly. And before you say it, yes, that was the best way to mount the cutter in the lathe at the time! It looks pretty bad...\n\nThingiverse link with all design files: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2493095\n\nPhotoshoot: http://imgur.com/a/ViXLG\n\nOther videos from this project:\nStop Motion Short: https://youtu.be/MByi1te9L8U\nStop Motion (Behind The Scenes): https://youtu.be/3khmncHSvXs\n\n\n\nMusic and stuff:\n\nClips from \"Rick and Morty\" s1e09 from Adult Swim\n\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nhttp://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\nArcadia - Wonders by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100326\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nHidden Agenda by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1200102\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nSpace Coast by Topher Mohr and Alex Elena\n\nAcid Jazz by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kevin_MacLeod/Jazz_Sampler/AcidJazz_1430\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nMove Ya by Max Surla/Media Right Productions","is_live":false}
