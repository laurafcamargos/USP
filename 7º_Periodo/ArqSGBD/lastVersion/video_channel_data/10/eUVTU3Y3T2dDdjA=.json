mode” network (DMN) is active. Its discovery 20 years ago inspired a raft of research into networks of brain regions and how they interact with each other.  New research, including a recent study of the brain on psilocybin, is revealing the default mode networks's role in memory, social awareness and sense of self. \n\nRead the full article at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-your-brain-is-doing-when-youre-not-doing-anything-20240205/\n\nRelated Papers:\n- \"A default mode of brain function\"  (Raichle et al., 2001) https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.98.2.676\n- \"Functional connectivity in the resting brain: A network analysis of the default mode hypothesis\" (Greicius et el., 2001) https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0135058100\n- \"20 years of the default mode network: A review and synthesis\" (Menon, 2023) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0896627323003082?via%3Dihub\n- \"Psilocybin desynchronizes the human brain\" (Siegel et al., 2024) https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07624-5\n\n---------\nChapters: \n00:00 What is the default mode network?\n00:43 Hans Berger and the discovery of the network\n02:36 Functional brain networks\n03:24 The network's role in episodic, prospective, and semantic memory\n04:14 Connection to self-awareness, social cognition, and theory of mind\n04:39 Mind wandering and self-reflection\n05:06 Interaction with other networks and brain dysfunction\n06:24 What psilocybin reveals about the network\n07:46 How the network creates a sense of self\n\n---------\n- VISIT our website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n- LIKE us on Facebook: / quantanews  \n- FOLLOW us Twitter:  / quantamagazine  \n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation: https://www.simonsfoundation.org","is_live":false}
