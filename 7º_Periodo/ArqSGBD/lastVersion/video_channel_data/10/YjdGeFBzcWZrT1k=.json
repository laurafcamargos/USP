animations by Sridhar Ramesh, with editing and narration by Grant Sanderson.\n\nEven though we described how winding numbers can be used to solve 2d equations at a high level, it's worth pointing out that there are a few details missing for if you wanted to actually implement this.  For example, in order to determine how often to sample points, you'd want to have some bounds on the rate at which the direction of the output changes.  We will perhaps discuss this more in a follow-on video!\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti: \nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
