Well well, look at you then.  That being the case, I might recommend that you continue on with the book \"Deep Learning\" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.\n\nThanks to Lisha Li (@lishali88) for her contributions at the end, and for letting me pick her brain so much about the material.  Here are the articles she referenced at the end:\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0233\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti: \nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nЗвуковая дорожка на русском языке: Влад Бурмистров.\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\nItalian: @teobucci\n\n-------------------\nVideo timeline\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:30 - Recap\n1:49 - Using training data\n3:01 - Cost functions\n6:55 - Gradient descent\n11:18 - More on gradient vectors\n12:19 - Gradient descent recap\n13:01 - Analyzing the network\n16:37 - Learning more\n17:38 - Lisha Li interview\n19:58 - Closing thoughts\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
