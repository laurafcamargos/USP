correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”.  Whoops!  I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up.  Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters.\n\nAnd while we're here, the animation at 9:55 misleadingly has the vortex kind of speed up during the transition, which it should not do.  Really, the velocity scales of eddies decrease for lower length scales.\n\nIntroduction to turbulence:\nhttp://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast825/ch7.pdf\n\nMore details on vortex stretching:\nhttps://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/tabak/vorticity.pdf\n\nVideo on NightHawkInLight with a similar demo:\nhttps://youtu.be/K94Cc21KEIA\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti: \nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
