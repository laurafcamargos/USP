This started as a \"play button\" project, but turned into an obsession. I recently came to the conclusion that there's no long-term winning this game (it has been shown to be NP hard, so I don't feel that bad) but AGH it should be easier than it is! \nJoin me in this video as I dive through the much fabled Game of Life, take a hike through a very strange space, and organize a dinner party.
