visualization of each country's current growth from Minutephysics and Aatish Bhatia:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc\n\nAnother good interactive to see what effect various parameters have on the shape of the curve:\nhttp://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html\n\nIf you want to hear a mathematician/epidemiologist's summary of COVID-19, I found this MSRI  talk very worthwhile:\nhttps://youtu.be/MZ957qhzcjI\n\nMarcel Salath√© on Contact Tracing:\nhttps://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1242430736944201730\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to

video:\nhttps://github.com/3b1b/videos/blob/master/_2020/sir.py\n\nHonestly, given that the code for that video is meant for demo purposes, and not meant to reflect the true data of COVID-19, if you want to apply these ideas to the current situation I'd recommend looking for more professional epidemiological modeling tools that are less centered around animations and pedagogy and more focused on accurate predictions.  For example, the Institute for Disease Modeling has a lot of models free for people to look at and play with.\n\n---------------\n\nOpening music:\nCandlepower by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://chriszabriskie.com/divider/\nArtist: http://chriszabriskie.com/\n\nOther music by Vincent Rubinetti.\r\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\r\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\r\n\r\nStream the music on Spotify:\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".
