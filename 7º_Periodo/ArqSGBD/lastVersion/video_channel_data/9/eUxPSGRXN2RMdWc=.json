In nature, most self-contained systems eventually reach thermodynamic equilibrium ... but not black holes. The interior volume of a black hole appears to forever expand without limit. But why? Susskind had a suspicion that a concept called computational complexity, which underpins everything from cryptography to quantum computing to the blockchain and AI, might provide an explanation.\n\nHe and his colleagues believe that the complexity of quantum entanglement continues to evolve inside a black hole long past the point of what’s called “heat death.”  Now Susskind and his collaborator, Adam Brown, have used this insight to propose a new law of physics: the second law of quantum complexity, a quantum analogue of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nRead the full article at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-new-paradox-black-holes-appear-to-evade-heat-death-20230606\n\nAlso appearing in the video: Xie Chen of CalTech, Adam Bouland of Stanford and Umesh Vazirani of UC Berkeley.\n\n00:00 Intro to a second law of quantum complexity\n01:16 Entropy drives most closed systems to thermal equilibrium.
