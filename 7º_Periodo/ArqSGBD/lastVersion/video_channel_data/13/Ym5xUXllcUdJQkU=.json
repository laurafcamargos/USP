In this video, I'm talking about the best way to shoot a beam of atoms at somethingâ€¦ As much as that sounds like a crazy scifi weapon, it's actually a great technique for delivering material to a growing crystalline thin film. All materials, even solids, have a vapor pressure and are slowly evaporating. When you put a chunk of material in a vacuum chamber and get it hot, it can evaporate so fast the vapor can be directed towards a target! Let me know in the comments if you have any questions about the MBE I could address in future videos!\n\nCheck out the other social media for updates and ramblings:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AlphaPhoenixChannel/\nhttps://twitter.com/Alpha__Phoenix\n\n#Crystals #Materials #Engineering\n\nThe MBE Lab is part of the Materials Department at UCSB.
