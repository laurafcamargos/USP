Perederiy:\nhttps://www.expunctis.com/2019/04/04/vtvt-another-demo.html\n\nIf you're looking for books on this topic, I'd recommend the one by Vladimir Arnold, \"Ordinary Differential Equations\"\n\nAlso, more Strogatz fun, you may enjoy his text \"Nonlinear Dynamics And Chaos\"\n\nCurious about why it's called a \"phase space\"?  You might enjoy this article:\nhttps://www.physics.umd.edu/courses/Phys404/Anlage_Spring10/The%20TangledTaleofPhaseSpace.pdf\n\nFrom a response on /r/3blue1brown, here are some interactives based on examples shown in the video:\nhttps://observablehq.com/@tophtucker/tales-from-the-romeo-and-juliet-phase-space\nhttps://observablehq.com/@mbostock/predator-and-prey\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\nVietnamese: @ngvutuan2811\n\n------------------\nAnimations made using manim, a scrappy open source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
