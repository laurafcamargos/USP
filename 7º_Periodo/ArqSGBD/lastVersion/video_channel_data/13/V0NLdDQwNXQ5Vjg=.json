camera! Today we're exploring waves, and how VERY careful timing of those waves can build into resonance. I've got a bunch of fun high-speed demos of waves on strings, many of which certainly fell into the \"man I really just wanted to see this work, but now that I have it, it will be a great video\" category :D\n\nThere's also a section on the Mythbusters' incarnation of \"Tesla's Earthquake Machine\", and why they weren't able to use resonance to bring down a steel truss bridge. The key is ALWAYS tracking the energy, but this time, we also see where the simple resonance model breaks down, and when you would need to bring out the big math ._.\n\nSo many demos demonstrate standing waves, but my goal here was to film the transient - I wanted to be able to show how those standing waves form - what does a SINGLE wave look like if you use it to build resonance? I honestly gained a much better understanding of standing waves after seeing this high speed footage, and I hope you do too!\n\nHope you enjoy!\n\n\nMassive thanks to my top Patreon supporters!\nbirdiesnbritts\nJohn Sosa Trustham\nVladimir Shklovsky\nAloysius Sparglepartz\nJason Whatley\nLohann Paterno Coutinho Ferreira\nJeffrey Mckishen\nnothings\nEugene Pakhomov\nGlenn Willen\nR520\nNick F\nMirko Rener\nChris Connett\nTyler Filla\nMiles Freeman\nBenjamin Manns\nMPG\nSeth Reuter\nDanny Thomas\nToby T\nLucy Fur\ntiaz \nDavid Antoš\nChris Duvarney\nNick Wage\nJohn T\nJack Serrino\nEthan Sifferman\n\n0:00 Building resonance with a DIY wave machine\n3:14 Resonance is sensitive\n5:24 MULTIPLE waves on a string?\n11:00 Standing wave hero shot\n12:15 Tesla's Earthquake Machine\n13:54 Exponential decay\n16:29 Breaking stuff costs energy\n18:06 How do waves TRAVEL on strings?\n20:29 When the simple model fails - big waves\n25:07 Wrap up - Tacoma Narrows\n\n\nMedia Credits:\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) http://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\nArcadia - Wonders by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100326 Artist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nRavenswood Bridge, Analogue Kid, Creative Commons Attribution license\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ravenswood_Bridge-edit.jpg","is_live":false}
