In this video I walk through my process for vapor-growing single crystals of ice. Starting with a small single-crystal substrate, a large crystal can be grown by depositing vapor. I use a vacuum chamber to evaporate/sublimate water at about -20 celcius, then a peltier cooler to deposit that water vapor back into a solid. The awesome thing is how crystallographic the samples look - lots beautiful hexagonal facets!\n\nExtra special thanks to Steve Mould for a fantastic explanation of the thermoelectric effect:\nhttps://youtu.be/O6waiEeXDGo\n\nOther videos in this series:\n\nThe Sound of Freezing, Explained!\nhttps://youtu.be/Wd_c0A8u3lw\nThe Sound of Freezing (Bonus Footage)\nhttps://youtu.be/hpzutKRSukw\nWhat is polycrystalline water?\nhttps://youtu.be/g7ONBuVtz-w\nA DIY Recipe for Giant Hexagonal Ice Crystals\nhttps://youtu.be/L0SYxpVab6M\nBig Hexagons of Ice 2: Thermoelectric Boogaloo\n[TBD]\n\n\nCheck out the other social media for updates and ramblings:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TryItAgain/\nhttps://twitter.com/Alpha__Phoenix\n\nInteresting articles for the extra-curious:\n\nJ.M.
