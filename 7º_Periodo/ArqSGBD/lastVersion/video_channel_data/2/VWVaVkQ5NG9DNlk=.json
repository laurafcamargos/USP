Well that ends today, with a real honest-to-goodness conference talk I gave this January. In our lab, we grow \"rocksalt\" PbSe crystals (with a structure that looks like a 3D checkerboard) on top of \"zincblende\" InAs crystals (with a structure that looks like a bunch of methanes stuck together). \n\nSo bust out your memory of high school chemistry and learn how bonding, charges, and crystalline symmetry all matter to actual scientific research going on right now at UCSB and Stanford!\n\nBig thanks to MROP, the Materials Research Outreach Program, for having me as a speaker, and also big thanks to Ram Seshadri, Director of the Materials Research Laboratory, for giving me the OK to share this recording!\nhttp://www.mrl.ucsb.edu/materials-research-outreach-program\n\nIf anybody's ludicrously curious, here's the paper this talk was based on:\ndoi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.033402\n\nCheck out the other social media for updates and ramblings:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AlphaPhoenixChannel/\nhttps://twitter.com/Alpha__Phoenix\n\n#Materials #Physics #Crystals\n\nMusic in this video:\nI Dunno by grapes is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)\nhttp://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626","is_live":false}
