He took on Netflix on user privacy and is now setting his sights on the latest neural networks and generative artificial intelligence. Can AI algorithms really predict our future behavior? Should programmers decide what invasive technologies are implemented, or should the public? How do so called \"objective\" machine learning algorithms actually reflect the biases and prejudices of society at large?\n\nNarayanan is a professor of computer science at Princeton University, affiliated with the Center for Information Technology Policy. He studies the societal impact of digital technologies.\n\nRead the full article at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/he-protects-privacy-and-ai-fairness-with-statistics-20230310/\n\n0:00 Who is Dr. Arvind Narayanan?\n0:27 Taking on Netflix and privacy\n1:17 Your apps are tracking you everywhere\n1:58 An unexpected defender of digital privacy\n2:10 Do AI technologies predicting behavior actually work?\n3:40 Does tech amply the best and and worst of society?\n\n- VISIT our Website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n- LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/QuantaNews\n- FOLLOW us Twitter: https://twitter.com/QuantaMagazine\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation https://www.simonsfoundation.org/ \n\n#artificialintelligence #technology #privacy","is_live":false}
