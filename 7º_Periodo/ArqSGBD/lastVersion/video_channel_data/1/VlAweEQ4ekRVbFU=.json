She is also pushing the boundaries of conservation biology, employing eDNA (environmental DNA) collection and analysis to search for endangered species and assess biodiversity in some of the most remote ecosystems on Earth. In 2019, her team’s work on Mount Everest revealed surprising results about the wide diversity of species, which range across the tree of life, that call this hostile, high-elevation mountain environment home.\n\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society runs four zoos and the aquarium in New York City and supports conservation and research projects in more than 60 countries around the world.\n\nRead the full article at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/she-tracks-the-dna-of-elusive-species-on-everest-and-in-the-andes-20230417/\n\n00:00 Why protecting biodiversity important and the role of science\n00:20 The Wildlife Conservation Society's Molecular Lab\n00:50 How Dr. Tracie Simon ending up studying amphibians in the high Andes\n01:39 How climate change is impacting high mountain environments\n02:49 Researching environmental DNA (eDNA) in wild environments\n03:27 Biodiversity eDNA analysis of life on Mt.
