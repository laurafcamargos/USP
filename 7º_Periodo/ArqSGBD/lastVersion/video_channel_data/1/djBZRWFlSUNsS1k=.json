the calculus referenced in this video?  Try taking a look at this one:\nhttps://youtu.be/m2MIpDrF7Es\n\nAnother perspective on this formula, from Mathologer:\nhttps://youtu.be/-dhHrg-KbJ0\n\nAnother perspective from this channel:\nhttps://youtu.be/mvmuCPvRoWQ\n\nAnd yet another from the blog Better Explained:\nhttps://betterexplained.com/articles/intuitive-understanding-of-eulers-formula/\n\nI'm not sure where the perspective shown in this video originates.  I do know you can find it in Tristan Needham's excellent book \"Visual Complex Analysis\", but if anyone has a sense of the first occurrence of this intuition do feel free to share.  It's simple and natural enough, though, that it's probably a view which has been independently thought up many times over.\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\nVietnamese: @ngvutuan2811\n\n------------------\n\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".
