But teleporting quantum particles and information is a far cry from beaming people through space. In some ways, it’s even more astonishing.\n\nJohn Preskill, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology, is one of the leading theoreticians of quantum computing and information. In this episode, co-host Janna Levin interviews him about entanglement, teleporting bits from coast to coast, and the revolutionary promise of quantum technology. Season 3, Episode 4\n\n- Find more information about this episode here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-quantum-teleportation-20240314/\n----------\n“The Joy of Why” is a Quanta Magazine podcast about curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge. The mathematician and author Steven Strogatz and the astrophysicist and author Janna Levin take turns interviewing leading researchers about the great scientific and mathematical questions of our time.
