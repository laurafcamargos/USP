They look like they're doing loops around Polaris, the north star, because it lies on the axis of Earth's rotation. If you point a camera at Polaris and spin it at the same rate as the sky turns (in the opposite direction), you can halt the rotation of the stars!\n\nMy first semi-sucessful attempt at this timelapse was taken through my window in Santa Barbara, where the sky (and the glass) are none too clear. Over break, I had the chance to visit a real middle-of nowhere dark sky site with power available - home in North Carolina! The building in the timelapse is my dad's observatory, and you can see the roof roll off and light up red when he goes out to observe. While I was home, there was one night where the temperature was predicted to stay above dew point, so I set up the camera!\n\nExplanation of the Astronomy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBU4mQP1Y3Y\nExplanation of the Photography: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBizFlGmLPM&t=775s\nFirst (published) attempt in Santa Barbara: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpI4WQCTe8U\n\nThis video\n- Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYcKaBzr87g\n- Fixed camera: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTfSu60TnMY\n\nIn this video:\n\nI dunno\ngrapes\nCreative Commons: Attribution\nhttp://ccmixter.org/files/grapes/16626\n\nI Found an Answer by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://www.twinmusicom.org/","is_live":false}
