seminal quantum computing algorithm, and emergent behavior in large language models.\n\nRead about more breakthroughs from 2023 at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-biggest-discoveries-in-computer-science-in-2023-20231220/\n\n00:05 Vector-Driven AI\nAs powerful as AI has become, the artificial neural networks that underpin most modern systems share two flaws: They require tremendous resources to train and operate, and it’s too easy for them to become inscrutable black boxes. Researchers have developed a new approach called hyperdimensional computing which is more versatile, making its computations far more efficient while also giving researchers greater insight into the model’s reasoning.\n- Original story with links to research papers can be found here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-approach-to-computation-reimagines-artificial-intelligence-20230413/\n\n04:01 Improving the Quantum Standard\nFor decades, Shor’s algorithm has been the paragon of the power of quantum computers. This set of instructions allows a machine that can exploit the quirks of quantum physics to break large numbers into their prime factors much faster than a regular, classical computer — potentially laying waste to much of the internet’s security systems. In August, a computer scientist developed an even faster variation of Shor’s algorithm, the first significant improvement since its invention.\n- Original story with links to research papers can be found here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/thirty-years-later-a-speed-boost-for-quantum-factoring-20231017/\n\n07:14 The Powers of Large Language Models\nGet enough stuff together, and you might be surprised by what can happen. This year, scientists found so-called “emergent behaviors,” in large language models — AI programs trained on enormous collections of text to produce humanlike writing. After these models reach a certain size, they can suddenly do unexpected things that smaller models can’t, such as solving certain math problems. \n- Original story with links to research papers can be found here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/\n\n- VISIT our Website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n- LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/QuantaNews\n- FOLLOW us Twitter: https://twitter.com/QuantaMagazine\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation: https://www.simonsfoundation.org/","is_live":false}
