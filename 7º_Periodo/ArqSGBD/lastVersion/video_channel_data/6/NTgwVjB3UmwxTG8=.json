gravitational wave background that’s made by supermassive black hole collisions, teleported quantum energy in the lab, and puzzled over JWST’s potentially cosmology-breaking discoveries.\n\nRead about

their supermassive central black holes merge — a smashup so violent that it shakes the very fabric of space-time itself. In June, multiple international collaborations announced that they had found the resulting gravitational waves that alter the apparent rhythm of pulsars.\n- Original story with links to research papers can be found here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/an-enormous-gravity-hum-moves-through-the-universe-20230628/\n\n04:23 Quantum Energy Teleportation\nA quantum energy teleportation protocol was proposed in 2008 and largely ignored. Now two independent experiments have shown that it works, effectively borrowing energy from a distant location and thus violating no sacred physical principles.\n- Original story with links to research papers can be found here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-use-quantum-mechanics-to-pull-energy-out-of-nothing-20230222/\n\n08:46 Discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope\nThe first round of big results from observations made by the James Webb Telescope were released this year, including observations of light from galaxies that glowed some 300 million years after the Big Bang and an abundance of supermassive black holes. \n- Original story with links to research papers can be found here: https://www.quantamagazine.org/jwst-spots-giant-black-holes-all-over-the-early-universe-20230814/\n\n- VISIT our Website: https://www.quantamagazine.org \n\n- LIKE us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/QuantaNews\n\n- FOLLOW us Twitter: https://twitter.com/QuantaMagazine\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation: https://www.simonsfoundation.org/","is_live":false}
