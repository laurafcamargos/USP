fund future projects: https://www.patreon.com/3blue1brown\nAn equally valuable form of support is to simply share some of the videos.\nSpecial thanks to these supporters:

Bhatia:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc\n\nData source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/#case-tot-outchina\n\nSome have (quite rightfully) commented on how you shouldn't look at the R^2 of linear regressions on cumulative data since even if the changes from one day to the next are completely random, the totals they add up to wouldn't be independent of each other.  Since the derivative of an exponential should also be an exponential, we could instead run the same test on the logarithms of the differences from day to day, which in this case gives R^2 = 0.91.\n\nWhile this video uses COVID-19 as a motivating example, the main goal is simply a math lesson on exponentials and logistic curves.  If you're looking for a video more focused on COVID-19 itself, I'd recommend taking a look at this one from Osmosis: https://youtu.be/cFB_C2ieW5I\n\nExtrapolation xkcd: https://xkcd.com/605/\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\n\n------------------\r\n\r\nThese animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\r\n\r\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\r\n\r\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\r\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\r\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\r\n\r\nStream the music on Spotify:\r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".  I really appreciate those who do this, as it helps make the lessons accessible to more people.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
