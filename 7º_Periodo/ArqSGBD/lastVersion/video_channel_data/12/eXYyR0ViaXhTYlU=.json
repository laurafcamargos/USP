We took a water taxi from Miller's Landing in Seward Alaska to Caines Head along Resurrection Bay. The boat dropped us off and we camped and explored Fort McGilvray. Fort McGilvray is an abandoned WWII military based with dozens of buildings (some of them underground). Me and Nathan put on our head lamps and climbed inside searching these abandoned buildings. \n\nCheck out our 6 week Alaskan adventure video here https://youtu.be/cNj6g55gMH8\n\nCheck out our camping and adventure playlist\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5EGD6MqjI6IASMaBDLcSgJbjtn8XEwkE\n\nCheck out Miller's Landing for more info about water taxis https://www.millerslandingak.com/\n\nOutdoor Boys on FACEBOOK\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TeamOutdoorBoys\n\nOutdoor Boys on INSTAGRAM\n@outdoorboyschannel\n\nBUY OUTDOOR BOYS T-SHIRTS\n http://shop.spreadshirt.com/catsandcarp/ \n\nMY CAMERA: \nGoPro Hero7 Black https://amzn.to/2wZGgXV\n\nMY EDITING SOFTWARE: \nVegas Platinum 16 https://amzn.to/3bIQqec\n\nMy FAVORITE OUTDOOR PRODUCTS\nFiskarAxe with 28\" Handle https://amzn.to/2wVQ8Ss\nBlast Match Fire Starter https://amzn.to/2R41cE0\nAdhesive Body Warmers https://amzn.to/2wKYWKZ","is_live":false}
